Marc is an amazing teacher and has taught me how to run injury free!!  This was not easy since I was a true heel striker which caused me to have four tibial stress fractures in three years while trying to train for the marathon.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

Take the strain and struggle out of hill running with this ChiRunning Hills and Trails Workshop.  It will increase your ability to conserve energy on the uphills, reduce impact on the downhills, and enjoy the views from the top pain-free.

Many people struggle with hills because they see uphills as more work and downhills as more impact. With ChiRunning hills can be fun, especially when you run them using technique and not leg strength. The key to running hills and trails is to both adapt your basic ChiRunning technique and apply some additional techniques.

<strong>You’ll learn how to:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Use your upper body to reduce your legwork</li>
 	<li>Run downhill with less impact while gaining speed</li>
 	<li>Make uphill running easier with relaxation techniques</li>
 	<li>Prevent injury and over-exertion</li>
 	<li>Apply special techniques to steep hills</li>
 	<li>Make modifications for steep downhils</li>
 	<li>Have more fun with less effort!</li>
</ul>
In the Hills and Trails workshop we take the same concepts that were learned on the flat and pavement and apply, with some important modifications, to hills and dirt. These modifications and some additional techniques are used to promote energy efficiency and injury prevention when running either hilly pavement or trails.

This workshop will expand on concepts that you learned in a Basics ChiRunning workshop.  It is therefore a requirement that participants complete a ChiRunning workshop or private session with a Certified Instructor before signing up for a Hills and Trails workshop.

&nbsp;

<strong>Notes:  </strong>

The workshop is limited to 6 participants so you will get lots of personal attention.

Hazel Wood, the instructor has extensive experience running hills and trails.  Some of the highlights of her trail running include:
<ul>
 	<li>38 Dipsea races in the Invitational Group with 3 Black Shirts for finishing in the top 35</li>
 	<li>Two time 1<sup>st</sup>Place in age group at Headlands 50K, one time second place</li>
 	<li>Five 50K races</li>
 	<li>One 50 mile race</li>

Marc is an amazing teacher and has taught me how to run injury free!!  This was not easy since I was a true heel striker which caused me to have four tibial stress fractures in three years while trying to train for the marathon.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

Jean was teaching ChiRunning, a technique that I had never heard of. I have always hated running and had never really done much distance running before. After being coached by Jean for 3 months, I have a new found love for running and even saw almost 5 minutes drop off my two mile run. Running has never felt so good or been so enjoyable for me. I look forward to continue using the ChiRunning technique as I continue toward my fitness goals. I cannot thank Jean enough for bringing this technique to the Warrior FIT program.""</em>

Marc is an amazing teacher and has taught me how to run injury free!!  This was not easy since I was a true heel striker which caused me to have four tibial stress fractures in three years while trying to train for the marathon.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you’ll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

• <strong>Plenty of Practice.</strong> You’ll practice walking drills and exercises designed to help you instill the technique in your body.</li>

Marc is an amazing teacher and has taught me how to run injury free!!  This was not easy since I was a true heel striker which caused me to have four tibial stress fractures in three years while trying to train for the marathon.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you’ll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

• <strong>Plenty of Practice.</strong> You’ll practice walking drills and exercises designed to help you instill the technique in your body.</li>

The ChiWalking technique applies principles from Tai Chi to recreational walking promoting energy efficiency and injury prevention. How you walk dictates how stress moves through your body while walking. Efficient walking technique distributes less stress on your body and requires less effort. Developing an efficient walking technique is an essential component in restoring or sustaining your walking practice. Efficient ChiWalking Technique can be learned through focused practice.

A ChiWalking Clinic takes you through 3 steps to start developing the skill of efficient pain-free walking:

1) Understand the efficient components of ChiWalking
2) Feel efficient components of ChiWalking in your own body
3) Practice efficient ChiWalking

Intro to ChiWalking Workshop consists of discussion, demonstration, drills and a small amount of walking making it perfect for individuals of all conditioning and experience levels interested in efficient walking.

<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.

If you’re inspired to try ChiRunning after experiencing how easy ChiWalking can be, you can choose to join the walk-run group and stay for the afternoon session for an additional $100.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

Assisted by a team of Certified Instructors, Danny will give you the personalized feedback you need to take your walking form and practice to the next level.
<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.

If you’re inspired to try ChiRunning after experiencing how easy ChiWalking can be, you can choose to join the walk-run group and stay for the afternoon session for an additional $100.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you'll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you'll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

• <strong>Plenty of Practice.</strong> You'll practice walking drills and exercises designed to help you instill the technique in your body.

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Bring a lunch and join us for an hour of informal questions &amp; answers.
<h5><strong>What You Need To Bring:</strong></h5>
• To maximize your learning experience, we recommend reading the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=19"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking book</a> and/or watching the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=31"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking DVD</a> prior to your workshop.

We will have a combo of indoor and outdoor time, so please bring appropriate clothing (layers). Feel free to bring water, light lunch and/or a snack.",Sarah Richardson-Senior Instructor,sarah@riseandshine.run,no,,,,"<strong>Nailed My Form.</strong>

I was so excited to find ChiRunning. Getting back into running as an adult was a little scary and I didn't know if I was doing it quite right. I did not have the time for pain, injuries or being out of commission, yet wanted to get back into shape... safely.  Sarah has helped me nail my form before injuries could crop up and I haven't looked back. She taught how to move my body with proper form and how to listen to my body.  I'm so glad that I can run with my friends and have been able to safely compete in races I never thought I could do!   ~Andrea",,,"<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Check. Check.</span></strong>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Being a busy working mom, I wanted an activity I could do on the fly and I chose running. But I hadn't ever been a runner before. ChiRunning was the perfect place to start. Sarah helped me stay safe and sound while I trained for my first race ever, which was a half-marathon! As a teacher, she was extremely patient and made it so understandable and I could actually FEEL if I was doing it right or wrong. I'm so glad that I took the time to learn my form, it made all the the difference in the world.   ~Maureen</span>",,,,,,,publish,164,sarah@riseandshine.run,sarah@riseandshine.run,,

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>Angela's chi running workshop gave me some remarkable feedback that has made a huge difference in my running. She figured out that I was turning out too much when I was placing my foot on the ground. She could see this clearly when did an exercise in the sand. After that, I worked on my pronation to make it more habitual to have the proper foot placement. Since that time, I have not had any of the associated pain in the Achilles or calf muscles which I used to experience. If any pain occurs, I just think of the foot placement and it goes away instantly. I have been running for over 45 years so having such an easy solution was well worth the investment in the course.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

For the first time ever, I finished with 'happy feet' and truly felt great. It took all my focus to stay relaxed and to remember to BREATHE but Angela's clinic, combined with reading Danny Dreyer's book, was revolutionary. If you think about it, we're taught how to swim, how to ride a bike, sometimes, how to skate and how to ski, etc. So why are we never taught how to run?

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>Angela James and ChiRunning changed my life! Sounds dramatic, but being in advertising, I've often bought into and sold the expectation of change as a big dramatic flash-bang moment. In fact, it's the quiet, joyful realization that not only did I PR my 36th marathon, but I enjoyed every moment of the sunny autumn run. Recovery was negligible, and it's all because of the springtime ChiRunning courses with Angela and her weekly Chi Runs, which are immensely valuable in practicing good chi form. Angela's advice, specific to the lesson on shoulders, ""to relax, stop trying so hard and just be"", has been something of a game changer in my running and life. So dramatics aside, ChiRunning delivered through Angela who, everyone will agree, is a bundle of positive energy, is life changing in a perfect chi-footsteps-in-the-sand way.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

Assisted by a team of Certified Instructors, Danny will give you the personalized feedback you need to take your walking form and practice to the next level.
<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.

If you’re inspired to try ChiRunning after experiencing how easy ChiWalking can be, you can choose to join the walk-run group and stay for the afternoon session for an additional $100.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you'll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

• <strong>Plenty of Practice.</strong> You'll practice walking drills and exercises designed to help you instill the technique in your body.

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Bring a lunch and join us for an hour of informal questions &amp; answers.
<h5><strong>What You Need To Bring:</strong></h5>
• To maximize your learning experience, we recommend reading the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=19"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking book</a> and/or watching the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=31"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking DVD</a> prior to your workshop.
• Please bring your own lunch and water.
• Wear athletic shoes, sunscreen, and weather appropriate clothing.

Jean was teaching ChiRunning, a technique that I had never heard of. I have always hated running and had never really done much distance running before. After being coached by Jean for 3 months, I have a new found love for running and even saw almost 5 minutes drop off my two mile run. Running has never felt so good or been so enjoyable for me. I look forward to continue using the ChiRunning technique as I continue toward my fitness goals. I cannot thank Jean enough for bringing this technique to the Warrior FIT program.”</em>

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>The opportunity to experience Angela's ChiRunning workshop was a serendipitous chain of good fortune. I have never been coached in running. I run to support my eating habits, run through problems and keep my dog company. What was there to learn? Angela's approach is embodying – mindfully. An accomplished runner, Angela has the running faith and the wisdom to know there is more to running than a good pair of shoes and pavement. Patient in her instruction, she tells why ChiRunning is important, what benefits it brings and how it improves performance. Before and after videos reveal your personal running story – step by step. Am I a ChiRunner? While I have adopted ChiRunning techniques and listen more to my body, positively I now consider myself an informed conscious runner. I am glad I took Angela's course, the experience was a perfect blend of land, sea, learning and wanting more.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>I attended Angela's ChiRunning Class this weekend at the Whistler Wanderlust. It was a very worthwhile experience. Angela is an excellent coach. She guided us through a series of exercises including a walk to run exercise which demonstrated that running could actually feel effortless. I never thought I would be saying this!! Chi running guides us to listen to what our body needs, while also being conscious of the inner chatter of our minds. It teaches us to intentionally guide our thoughts to focus on our process, and lead from our core and inner strength. In addition to helping us run safely and efficiently, Chi Running provides excellent tools for grounding, and connecting with our authentic power.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

The goal is to learn to move as efficiently as possible. You'll learn how to make running easier by using your legs less and using gravity and your core muscles more (less impact on the ground and less energy usage means better recovery time and/or going faster and/or longer with less effort).

You will learn about running posture, how and where your feet should land, how your arms should swing and cadence.

You will be videotaped at the end of the workshop. Within 3 days of class, I will send you the video recording along with my voice over comments.  You will get specific feedback on how well you've assimilated the new information along with tips on how to keep improving.

This workshop is appropriate for everyone, from the beginner to the elite!

This investment will out weigh the hassle/money/time off that you would deal with a running injury! <strong>Prevention vs. Treatment!</strong>

Walking and running are one of the best ways to lose weight and stay fit.

Most people walk and run by using the muscles in their legs. As a result, people lead with their legs and pull themselves forward (most walking and running injuries are mainly due to improper use of leg muscles!)

ChiRunning/ChiWalking teaches you to use your core muscles rather than your leg muscles, allowing your upper body to lead your lower body. This forward movement engages the pull of gravity, which then becomes your ally. This revolutionary method uses the same principles of T’ai Chi by working with core muscles, body alignment and body/mind integration resulting in a proven pain-free, energy efficient way to walk and run.

This, in turn, creates a more focused and enjoyable workout experience for lifelong health and energy.

It’s great for all fitness levels! If you are a beginner, you will learn the right technique before doing it incorrectly. For experienced walkers or runners, find out how you can take your performance to the next level. If you are injured, find out what you are doing incorrectly so you can get back to the sport you love.",Lisa Pozzoni,easyfitnesssolutions@yahoo.com,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,23,lisa@easyfitnesssolutions.com,lisa@easyfitnesssolutions.com,,

I was so excited to find ChiRunning. Getting back into running as an adult was a little scary and I didn't know if I was doing it quite right. I did not have the time for pain, injuries or being out of commission, yet wanted to get back into shape... safely.  Sarah has helped me nail my form before injuries could crop up and I haven't looked back. She taught how to move my body with proper form and how to listen to my body.  I'm so glad that I can run with my friends and have been able to safely compete in races I never thought I could do!   ~Andrea",,,"<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Check. Check.</span></strong>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Being a busy working mom, I wanted an activity I could do on the fly and I chose running. But I hadn't ever been a runner before. ChiRunning was the perfect place to start. Sarah helped me stay safe and sound while I trained for my first race ever, which was a half-marathon! As a teacher, she was extremely patient and made it so understandable and I could actually FEEL if I was doing it right or wrong. I'm so glad that I took the time to learn my form, it made all the the difference in the world.   ~Maureen</span>",,,,,,,publish,164,sarah@riseandshine.run,sarah@riseandshine.run,,

We will have a combo of indoor and outdoor time, so please bring appropriate clothing (layers). Feel free to bring water, light lunch and/or a snack.",Sarah Richardson-Master Instructor,sarah@riseandshine.run,no,,,,"<strong>Nailed My Form.</strong>

I was so excited to find ChiRunning. Getting back into running as an adult was a little scary and I didn't know if I was doing it quite right. I did not have the time for pain, injuries or being out of commission, yet wanted to get back into shape... safely.  Sarah has helped me nail my form before injuries could crop up and I haven't looked back. She taught how to move my body with proper form and how to listen to my body.  I'm so glad that I can run with my friends and have been able to safely compete in races I never thought I could do!   ~Andrea",,,"<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Check. Check.</span></strong>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Being a busy working mom, I wanted an activity I could do on the fly and I chose running. But I hadn't ever been a runner before. ChiRunning was the perfect place to start. Sarah helped me stay safe and sound while I trained for my first race ever, which was a half-marathon! As a teacher, she was extremely patient and made it so understandable and I could actually FEEL if I was doing it right or wrong. I'm so glad that I took the time to learn my form, it made all the the difference in the world.   ~Maureen</span>",,,,,,,publish,164,sarah@riseandshine.run,sarah@riseandshine.run,,

Assisted by a team of Certified Instructors, Danny will give you the personalized feedback you need to take your walking form and practice to the next level.
<h5><strong>Is This Workshop for Me?</strong></h5>
Yes! ChiWalking is beneficial for everyone, even those recovering from or managing illness or injury. The ChiWalking principles are covered in the first half of the running workshop. There will be no running during this time, but you will practice plenty of walking exercises &amp; drills.

If you’re inspired to try ChiRunning after experiencing how easy ChiWalking can be, you can choose to join the walk-run group and stay for the afternoon session for an additional $100.
<h5><strong>You’ll Learn How To:</strong></h5>
• <strong>Maximize the power of your core to move forward.</strong>  Most walking injuries occur from the waist down. When we initiate movement from our core, the body’s largest muscle group, we don’t need to use our legs for propulsion. This greatly reduces impact, pain, and risk of injury. A strong core also improves posture, balance, and stability.

• <strong>Unite your Upper Body and Lower Body. </strong>The Chi techniques are all about keeping your energy flowing so you can move efficiently. You’ll learn how to optimize your movement to keep the workload balanced between your Upper Body and Lower Body.

• <strong>Get the results you want with fitness walking. </strong>With good body mechanics and relaxation techniques, you'll improve your endurance and gain speed while preventing fatigue. You’ll be able to walk farther and faster with less effort so you can make your fitness goals a reality.

• <strong>Plenty of Practice.</strong> You'll practice walking drills and exercises designed to help you instill the technique in your body.

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Bring a lunch and join us for an hour of informal questions &amp; answers.
<h5><strong>What You Need To Bring:</strong></h5>
• To maximize your learning experience, we recommend reading the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=19"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking book</a> and/or watching the <a href=""https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=31"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiWalking DVD</a> prior to your workshop.
• Please bring your own lunch and water.
• Wear athletic shoes, sunscreen, and weather appropriate clothing.

Outdoor activity shouldn't hurt your body, it's the WAY you move that can cause problems. The two biggest causes of all fitness injuries are overuse of muscles and too much impact to your joints. Both of these can be identified and managed through the mindful movement techniques taught in the Chi method. In this free Chi Series, Danny Dreyer, founder of ChiRunning (and Asheville local) will talk about how to train, condition, and strengthen sustainably. Integrating Chi methods in a way that'll keep you moving and feeling fabulous for years to come whether walking, running, hiking, or cross-training. Come with any of your own training questions, and be prepared to get energized by adding a mindful approach to your fitness practice! Each Month Danny will discuss a new topic. Check out the notes below for this month's focus.

Walking and running are one of the best ways to lose weight and stay fit.

This event is being hosted by Sports Medicine Acupuncturist, Jody Murray from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Acupxtherapy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Acupuncture Therapy at AZSDS</a>, who will be on hand to answer your sports medicine questions. Jody will be available after the workshop to quickly evaluate any injuries you may currently have.

Most people walk and run by using the muscles in their legs. As a result, people lead with their legs and pull themselves forward (most walking and running injuries are mainly due to improper use of leg muscles!)

ChiRunning/ChiWalking teaches you to use your core muscles rather than your leg muscles, allowing your upper body to lead your lower body. This forward movement engages the pull of gravity, which then becomes your ally. This revolutionary method uses the same principles of T’ai Chi by working with core muscles, body alignment and body/mind integration resulting in a proven pain-free, energy efficient way to walk and run.

This, in turn, creates a more focused and enjoyable workout experience for lifelong health and energy.

It’s great for all fitness levels! If you are a beginner, you will learn the right technique before doing it incorrectly. For experienced walkers or runners, find out how you can take your performance to the next level. If you are injured, find out what you are doing incorrectly so you can get back to the sport you love.",Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni,easyfitnesssolutions@yahoo.com,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,23,lisa@easyfitnesssolutions.com,lisa@easyfitnesssolutions.com,,

The ChiWalking technique emphasizes the <strong>proper biomechanics of walking</strong> including: good  posture, loose joints, engaging one’s core muscles, and relaxing the peripheral muscles of the arms and legs.

This approach makes walking <strong>easier on the body and helps improve and eliminate the aches, pains and discomfort of walking incorrectly.</strong> Since walking is such a basic, every day movement, when your walking form is improved, the benefits are far reaching.

I will guide you through some exercises and drills designed <strong>to leave you with a clear sense of what the Chi Walking technique feels like in your body.  We will go over Posture, Moving from your Center/Core and Relaxed Arms and Legs.</strong>

<strong>You will leave this class with a good understanding of how to move your body with the ChiWalking technique.</strong>

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>The opportunity to experience Angela's ChiRunning workshop was a serendipitous chain of good fortune. I have never been coached in running. I run to support my eating habits, run through problems and keep my dogs company. What was there to learn? Angela's approach is embodying – mindfully. An accomplished runner, Angela has the running faith and the wisdom to know there is more to running than a good pair of shoes and pavement. Patient in her instruction, she tells why ChiRunning is important, what benefits it brings and how it improves performance. Before and after videos reveal your personal running story – step by step. Am I a ChiRunner? While I have adopted ChiRunning techniques and listen more to my body, positively I now consider myself an informed conscious runner. I am glad I took Angela's course, the experience was a perfect blend of land, sea, learning and wanting more.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

<p class=""quote""><span class=""quotationmark"">“</span>Angela James and ChiRunning changed my life! Sounds dramatic, but being in advertising, I've often bought into and sold the expectation of change as a big dramatic flash-bang moment. In fact, it's the quiet, joyful realization that not only did I PR my 36th marathon, but I enjoyed every moment of the sunny autumn run. Recovery was negligible, and it's all because of the springtime ChiRunning courses with Angela and her weekly Chi Runs, which are immensely valuable in practicing good chi form. Angela's advice, specific to the lesson on shoulders, ""to relax, stop trying so hard and just be"", has been something of a game-changer in my running and life. So dramatics aside, ChiRunning delivered through Angela who, everyone will agree, is a bundle of positive energy, is life-changing in a perfect chi-footsteps-in-the-sand way.<span class=""quotationmark endquote"">”</span></p>

The goal is to learn to move as efficiently as possible. You'll learn how to make running easier by using your legs less and using gravity and your core muscles more (less impact on the ground and less energy usage means better recovery time and/or going faster and/or longer with less effort).

You will learn about running posture, how and where your feet should land, how your arms should swing and cadence.

You will be videotaped at the end of the workshop. Within 3 days of class, I will send you the video recording along with my voice over comments.  You will get specific feedback on how well you've assimilated the new information along with tips on how to keep improving.

This workshop is appropriate for everyone, from the beginner to the elite!

This investment will out weigh the hassle/money/time off that you would deal with a running injury! <strong>Prevention vs. Treatment!</strong>

<strong>Seeing the video</strong> of how bad my form was, this helped me reflect to a number of past problems and understand why they occurred. ~Stephen C

My favorite part (among many) was <strong>when you ran with us</strong> and was able to identify what I was doing wrong and how to address it. I referred back to that suggestion the next day and it worked! ~ Terry M

My favorite part is always Lisa's energy. She has such a<strong> positive energy and is very passionate</strong> about teaching Chi Running and it really comes across in the class. Also running is always a work in progress, there is always something you can do to run better. Chi Running and Lisa's classes are an awesome way to see how to improve your running. ~ Charles J

<strong>Going outside and practicing after each lesson.</strong> I like that Lisa had us practice the chi running way and then<strong> compare</strong> to our old way during the same trip. I could really feel the difference! ~ Karla H

<strong>The video evaluation</strong>. I thought I was applying a midfoot landing before I came to the workshop and quickly found out I wasn’t. ~ Missy F",,,"I have recommended the workshops to several friends. The ChiRunning Essentials class costs as much as a new pair of running shoes and you will get a lot more out of the class. I started running in my last 40's and realized, after I got hurt, that I should have worked on my running form. The classes are a great way to evaluate and improve your form. If I had taken the class before I hurt my knee, I think the injury would not have happened. ~ Charles J",,,"Lisa is very thorough.

We won’t be doing a lot of walking.
The focus will be on building a solid base of knowledge that you will carry forward in your walking program.
You’ll get lots of personal attention and enjoy a rich learning experience packed with good information to help you walk in balance for the rest of your life.

Create balance in your body and yourself with ChiWalking.
ChiWalking will teach you to move from your center, your core, and not use your legs to walk!! You’ll learn proper body alignment and movement techniques that will give you a powerful sense of balance and stability, as well as relaxation and spaciousness in your body and mind.

<strong>What you’ll get:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Principles of Tai Chi applied to Walking</li>
 	<li>Efficient Posture and Alignment</li>
 	<li>Movement of your Dantien (center) to create forward motion</li>
 	<li>Introduction to the ChiWalking method</li>
 	<li>Upper body and lower body usage</li>
 	<li>Injury-prevention techniques</li>
 	<li>Core muscle drills and exercises</li>
 	<li>Body Looseners</li>
 	<li>Personal check-in tricks and tools</li>
 	<li>How to relax and conserve energy at any walking speed</li>
</ul>
Since we are in the Training Center,<em> it will be possible for participants to bring quiet, well-behaved dogs.</em> We will spend a few minutes at the end of the workshop practicing walking our dogs and doing slow/fast/normal pace transitions using ChiWalking technique. You may bring a crate or ex-pen or use a guest crate at the facility. Proof of rabies vaccination for dogs is required. Monadnock Humane Society also has some lovely trails that you can walk your dog on before or after the workshop.

Monadnock Humane Society Training Center is a large air-conditioned space with excellent matting on the floor!! We may also go outside to work on a few small hills. The Shelter itself will be closed and we will have access to the bathrooms. Currently, the Shelter is only adopting animals by appointment - if you would like to investigate adoption, please check their website https://monadnockhumanesociety.org/ and make an appointment after the workshop.

Walking and running are one of the best ways to lose weight and stay fit.

Most people walk and run by using the muscles in their legs. As a result, people lead with their legs and pull themselves forward (most walking and running injuries are mainly due to improper use of leg muscles!)

ChiRunning/ChiWalking teaches you to use your core muscles rather than your leg muscles, allowing your upper body to lead your lower body. This forward movement engages the pull of gravity, which then becomes your ally. This revolutionary method uses the same principles of T’ai Chi by working with core muscles, body alignment, and body/mind integration resulting in a proven pain-free, energy-efficient way to walk and run.

This, in turn, creates a more focused and enjoyable workout experience for lifelong health and energy.

It’s great for all fitness levels! If you are a beginner, you will learn the right technique before doing it incorrectly. For experienced walkers or runners, find out how you can take your performance to the next level. If you are injured, find out what you are doing incorrectly so you can get back to the sport you love.

Success comes to the athlete who adapts quickly and effectively to the constantly changing conditions of his or her event. Excelling at endurance involves having a running technique that is not static and not dependent predominantly on the legs, but a fluid movement using the whole body. Many runners learn the hard way that running uphill, or into the wind, requires a different running technique than running on flat ground.

The most efficient runners constantly monitor their energy expenditure and adjust accordingly to create the highest output with the least amount of effort. Knowing when to take advantage of downhills and when to relax and rest on the run is also a great skill to have. That’s only one aspect of what you’ll learn in this highly informative workshop led by ChiRunning founder, Danny Dreyer, a seasoned ultramarathoner and running coach for over twenty years.

Here is some of what you’ll learn in this experiential seminar:
<ul>
 	<li>What you can do to become a truly efficient runner</li>
 	<li> The importance of “Whole-body” running</li>
 	<li> How posture creates greater efficiency</li>
 	<li> Do’s and Don’ts of endurance running</li>
</ul>

Success comes to the athlete who adapts quickly and effectively to the constantly changing conditions of his or her event. Excelling at endurance involves having a running technique that is not static and not dependent predominantly on the legs, but a fluid movement using the whole body. Many runners learn the hard way that running uphill, or into the wind, requires a different running technique than running on flat ground.
