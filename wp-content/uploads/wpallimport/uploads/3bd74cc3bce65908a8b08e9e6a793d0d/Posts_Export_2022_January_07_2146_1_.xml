		<title><![CDATA[Midfoot strike, Forefoot Strike or Heel Strike, which one is Best?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h5></h5>
There seems to be much debate in the running community today on what is the best footstrike for running. Runners of all levels divide themselves into three basic camps: the midfoot strikers, the forefoot strikers and the heel strikers. So, here is my attempt to put forward my best understanding of the three basic types of foot strike and what each one does for a runner.

<strong>The Midfoot Strike</strong>
The midfoot strike is characterized as having your heel and the ball of your foot touching the ground simultaneously with each foot strike. You can see this very clearly when you watch young children run. They always land with their whole foot on the ground. I would say that at most people run this way as kids.

In the ChiRunning technique, we promote the midfoot strike because it is, for most runners, the most injury-preventive way to run. Our emphasis is on preventing the lower legs (including the knees) from over-working, because this area of the body is where, <em>conservatively speaking</em>, 90% of all running injuries occur. Plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, shin splints, calf pulls, knee pain, IT band problems, over-pronation, bunions, metatarsal and tibial stress fractures, and hammer toes lead the list of the most common running injuries. This list is immense compared to everything that can go wrong <em>above</em> the knees.

The propulsion in ChiRunning comes from allowing your body to fall forward with the pull of gravity, not from pushing yourself forward with your feet and legs. For this reason it is more energy-efficient because your legs are not required for propulsion. When your feet come down onto the ground, they land either under your center of mass, in a midfoot strike. When you lean into the pull of gravity, the only work required of your legs is to provide momentary support for your body between strides. Landing on your midfoot, in most cases, either reduces or eliminates the work done by A.) the lower leg muscles…especially the shins and calves, and B.) the two tendons that are most commonly injured… the plantar tendon and the achilles tendon.

The ChiRunning technique is primarily focused on energy efficiency and injury-prevention with speed being a secondary focus.

<strong>The Forefoot Strike</strong>
The forefoot is basically the balls of the feet. If your heels don’t touch the ground when you run, you’re a forefoot striker.

Sprinters, middle-distance runners, and some triathletes tend to prefer running on the forefoot because of the extra speed obtained by “paw-back” and “toeing off.” This way of running is great if you want lots of speed, but it puts the responsibility for most of the body’s propulsion squarely onto the legs…especially the lower legs. Some of the faster elite middle-distance runners (i.e. Kenyans, Moroccans, Ethiopians, Mexicans) run with a forward lean added in combination with a forefoot strike. This takes some but not all of the burden off the lower legs.

Because forefoot running is primarily used for running at faster speeds, energy efficiency tends to take a distant back seat. As far as being injury-preventive, forefoot striking helps prevent knee injuries because it lowers the impact to the knees. This is a good thing. But the problem with it is that running on the balls of your feet <em>increases</em> the workload on your calves, shins, achilles tendons, and plantar tendons, so you risk either overworking a muscle or pulling a tendon if you go too far or too fast while running on your forefeet.

Another type of forefoot landing is when running barefoot, or in minimalist shoes. Because there is no cushioning in a minimal shoe, or barefoot, the runner lands on the forefoot, but immediately comes down onto the full foot during the support stance of her stride. This keeps the lower leg muscles from being overused or injured. Many people experience sore calves when switching to minimalist running, which makes it even that much more important to always relax the lower legs when landing.

<strong>The Heel Strike</strong>
Heel striking is when your heel strikes the ground in front of your body. At least 75% of all runners run with a heel strike. The interesting thing about this fact is that, although it is by far the most common of all the footstrike patterns, it is not done by choice, but by default. The vast majority of all runners are not elite runners or competitors, they’re just regular folks like you and me, who like to run and like to stay fit.

Most recreational runners tend to run with their body in an upright position… with no lean at all. This forces them to have to reach forward with their legs when they run…and when you run upright and reach with your legs, your feet will <em>always</em> land in front of your body and your heels will come down first. When you run this way, you’re basically putting on the brakes with each stride, which sends a lot of impact to your lower legs and knees. For this reason, many heel strikers complain of knee pain at some point in their running career. This is the group that keeps orthopedists and physical therapists in business.

But, just because you might be a heel striker, it doesn’t mean you’re doomed to be a heel striker for the rest of your life. Work on improving your running technique. If you can learn to run safely and efficiently, you’ll be eliminating the causes of running injuries and you won’t have to worry about ending up in a doctor’s office getting fixed.

The midfoot strike works for most runners…the forefoot strike works for some runners…but, the heel strike doesn’t seem to work well for anybody. Try all three and see which one works the best for you.

With the <a href="https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=9">ChiRunning book</a>, DVD/Video, or <a href="https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=25">audio CD</a> you can easily learn the midfoot strike. We offer you an alternative way to approach your running so that you can learn the midfoot strike and spend many more years enjoying one of the world’s best and most natural sports.

Happy trails,

		<title><![CDATA[How to Prevent Knee Pain from Running]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[There's a reason why knee pain is often referred to as "Runner's Knee." Current statistics report that 30 - 50% of <em>all </em>runners get knee pain from running every year. That's a pretty high number, and it's one of the biggest reasons why running gets labeled as a high-injury sport.

I have my own take on running and it's a little different. It's that running is blamed for knee pain when it's not actuality running that causes problems. It's the <em>way</em> people run that leads to pain and injury. The truth is, if you can learn to run with proper running form, where there is minimal impact or undue stress to your knees, you'll never have knee problems. It's a surprisingly simple fix, and entirely possible, contrary to what many people believe.

Here are some ways to improve your running technique, avoid knee pain, and insure that you can run for many more years without ever having to give it all up someday because your knees are toast.

[caption id="attachment_2766" align="alignright" width="250"]<img class="wp-image-2766" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2018-05-27-at-11.36.33-AM.png" alt="Runner creating knee pain by over-reaching with their legs" width="250" height="245" /> Over-striding creates a heel strike[/caption]
<h5><strong>Avoid heel striking</strong></h5>
Don't over-stride and let your feet get ahead of you. Always make it a point to NEVER step past your knees, and learn to let your legs swing <em>rearward</em>, not forward. When your feet land in front of your knees, you putting on the brakes with every foot strike, sending a major impact to your knees, which were never designed to be shock absorbers.

Eventually, all of this impact to your knees leads to either joint pain or soreness in your muscles. If this happens to you, listen to what your body is trying to tell you, and change your stride mechanics, or you could end up on the bench.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Always lean from your ankles and let your stride open up behind you. Let your feet land beneath you instead of in front of you.
<h5><strong>Don't lift your knees when you run</strong></h5>
<img class="wp-image-5203 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/CR-Stride-2-1-185x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="339" />

That's right. Pay no attention to the advice of all those running magazines that tell you to lift your knees and reach forward for a longer stride. That advice is intended for sprinters... and certainly not how you should run any distance longer than a mile. Lifting your knees, makes your feet hit the ground <em>in front</em> of your body and you'll be putting on the brakes with every stride.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Keep your knees swinging low. At the back end of each stride, bend your knees and let your heels float up behind you. You should always be thinking, "<a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/what-a-real-chirunner-looks-like/">knees down, heels up</a>."
<h5></h5>
<h5><strong>Lean your entire body forward</strong></h5>
Remember, anytime your foot comes down in front of your body, you're putting the brakes and the shock of that deceleration is going straight into your knees.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Always try to land in a <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/running-with-a-relaxed-midfoot-strike/">midfoot strike</a>.
<h5><strong>Keep your knees soft and bent</strong></h5>
Many runners over-stride and then straighten their knees as they land. This creates an incredible amount of impact to the heel and the knee.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Make a pact with yourself that you will never again straighten your legs when you run. Problem solved.
<h5><strong>Keep your feet aimed in the direction you are running</strong></h5>
If your feet splay it can create knee pain because you're torquing your knee with every foot strike. Imagine someone grabbing your ankle and twisting it to the outside 1200 times every 10 minutes!<img class="wp-image-5204 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Alignment.Directional-300x227.png" alt="" width="263" height="199" />

<strong>What to do:</strong> Always run with your feet pointed in the direction you're headed. Rotate your entire leg inward towards your centerline until your feet are parallel and pointing forward. This can permanently fix your problem by strengthening your adductors to realign your legs. Then, your knees will hinge in the direction they were designed to, instead of twisting as they bend. Foot splay can create inflammation in the iliotibial band which, at its lower end, attaches to the tibia just below your knee. The misalignment of your legs can often be mistaken for a knee problem.
<strong>More to do:</strong> Increase the amount of medial rotation of your legs over a number of weeks to give your legs time to adjust to their new direction of movement. Changing the biomechanics of your body takes time and persistence, but it's well worth it if you want to never have knee pain again.
<h5><strong>Don't rely on cushioned shoes to fix your knees</strong></h5>
It's always better to fix a running form problem from the inside out. For this reason it's better to adopt proper running form, rather than rely on cushioned running shoes, which can actually exacerbate knee problems. My favorite brands are <a href="http://www.xeroshoes.com/go/chirunning">Xero Shoes </a>and Lems!
<strong>What to do:</strong> Go for low-profile neutral shoes and run with a shorter stride to reduce impact. Allow your body lots of time to make the necessary adjustments toward a softer landing.

Taking good care of your knees should be a high priority, especially if you want to continue to enjoy running year after year. Reducing torque and impact are the two best places to work on your running form. This is how you begin to build a life insurance policy for your knees, and they'll thank you every time you lace up.

		<title><![CDATA[10 Tips to Keep Your Legs Fresh and Healthy for Your Next Run]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[How many times have you started a run and felt like your legs were made of concrete? Surprisingly, they might not feel so bad from something that you <em>did</em> as from something that you <em>didn’t</em> do. Taking good care of your legs before and after running can improve the ease in your running workouts, increase performance, and even speed up your recovery time.
<div>
<h4><strong>Before Running:</strong></h4>
<h5>1. Fueling</h5>
We suggest eating at least 3 hours before running. Be aware that almost nothing you eat immediately before a run will digest enough to give you energy during your run. If you have to eat, choose foods you can easily absorb, such as a banana, a spoonful of honey, or a handful of dried fruit.
<h5>2. Hydration</h5>
Drink at least 8 oz. of water a half hour before your workout. If you're going for longer than a 10K, you might consider taking a water bottle or planning a route that has water stops along the way. Staying hydrated can help reduce lactic acid build-up and keep your legs from cramping, especially in hot weather.
<h5>3. <strong>Loosen up</strong></h5>
Conventional wisdom is now recommends not to stretch <em>before</em> running. But, we recommend you try the ChiRunning Body Looseners instead. Ankle rolls, hip rotations, and knee circles are a few gentle exercises you can do to get your body loose and relaxed without straining cold muscles and joints. See the <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product/chirunning-book/">ChiRunning book</a> or <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product/chirunning-dvd/">DVD</a> for a detailed explanations.
<h5>4. Start off slowly</h5>
Begin running with a very relaxed, but shorter stride - not too fast. Increase your pace slowly until you're running at your desired level. If you take off too fast, you risk "running out of gas" or producing too much lactic acid for your leg to burn off, and you’ll feel more soreness in your legs afterwards.
<h5>5. Check your shoes</h5>
Track the mileage on your running shoes. At about 500 miles, mid-soles can become too compressed to return to their original shape between runs, and your feet and legs will begin to notice. Be sure to <a href="https://az675379.vo.msecnd.net/media/2273362/lcdc-24x36-posterchaussures3-en.pdf">replace your running shoes</a> regularly. Make sure you are running in the best running shoes for you.

[thrive_leads id='5814']
<h4><strong>After Running:</strong></h4>
<h5>6. Stretch it out</h5>
After a 3-5 minute cool down jog, stretch thoroughly. Don't just jump back into your car and head off to your next event, or you could be walking around with tight legs for the rest of the day. Doing a <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-07-traditional-doesnt.html">cool down and then stretching</a> period allows the lactic acid (created by your muscles) to be flushed out into your bloodstream and eliminated from your body. It can also release any residual tension in your legs.
<h5>7. Soak for circulation</h5>
Take a hot bath or relax in a hot tub after your workout if you can. Soaking your legs warms your muscles, relaxes them, and aids in <a href="https://www.active.com/fitness/articles/6-ways-to-improve-blood-circulation">flushing out toxins and surplus lactic acid</a> released during exercise. Unfortunately, a shower doesn't work as well,  but it's still good for your legs if a bath is out of the question.
<h5>8. Freshen your legs</h5>
Do "leg drains" by lying on your back with your legs extended vertically and feet propped against a wall for 3-4 minutes. This drains the old blood out of your legs so fresh, clean blood can be pumped back into them when you stand up. You can do leg drains either immediately after stretching or after soaking. Either way, you'll feel a marked difference in your legs afterwards.
<h5>9. Refuel your system</h5>
After strenuous workouts, your next two meals should be solid protein meals to help rebuild your muscles. Add in a hearty green salad and fresh vegetables to replenish your system with valuable minerals.
<h5>10. Rehydrate</h5>
Whether or not you're a regular runner, you should be drinking water all day long. Eight to ten glasses of water spread throughout the day will replenish the fluid lost to exercise. Don't drink your water all at once; just sip it... but keep an even flow going.

The more time you spend taking care of your body between runs, the more it will reward you with many years of enjoyable workouts. You'll also notice an increase in your performance levels. It's a universal law: the more preparation we put into something, the better the results. The same applies to your ChiRunning technique... as your running form gets more efficient, you can expect your <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/what-makes-chi-training-different/">recovery time to <em>decrease</em></a>. What's not to like about that?

		<title><![CDATA[The Quickest Way to Improve Your Running with a Metronome]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h5>Your body thrives on rhythm</h5>
Your heart beat, your breath rate, your love for dancing, are all based on rhythms in your body or rhythms that you've established in your life. The more rhythms you establish, the better your body likes it.

When you're body has a rhythm to follow it doesn't work as hard. It knows what to do and when to do it. If you go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, your body experiences a rhythm... "now I get to rest, now it's time to get up."

One rhythm I'm acutely aware of when I run, is my cadence…the number of strides I take per minute. I have found that most people do best when they run with a steady rhythmical cadence. It varies slightly from person to person based on height, body structure and personality type, but the optimal cadence for humans, seems to fall between 170-180 strides per minute.

When your cadence is always the same, a lot of things seem to fall into place. When you cadence stays at a steady rate, it requires that you vary your stride length when you're running at different speeds. If you think of changing your stride length to accommodate different levels of effort, your body learns to run with a set of gears and work in much the same way as your bicycle or your car.

Several clients have said that running with a metronome gives them a sense of stability in their running because their cadence becomes the single constant that underlies everything else that's going on when they're running. This allows them a greater ability to focus on other ChiRunning Form Focuses. I love running with my metronome and I use it almost every time I run, and always in races. It helps me most in creating a sense of effortlessness in my legs and it is without question the best training tool that I've ever run with.
<h5><strong>How to use the metronome to improve your running</strong></h5>
<h6><strong>Step One: Determine Your Current Cadence</strong></h6>
When you first begin to work on your cadence you should start by measuring your current cadence (the number of strides you take per minute). To determine the cadence you're currently running, take your metronome and go out for an easy run at whatever pace you would run for a typical training run. For this test be sure to run on a flat course and preset your metronome to 170 bpm. Then, turn the volume off.

After about 5 minutes of running, turn the volume up on the metronome and match the beep of the metronome to your stride rate by pressing the (+) or (-) button. It may take a minute or two for you to perfectly align both, but just feel the rate at which you sense your feet hitting the ground, and then adjust the
beep of the metronome faster or slower until it's a perfect match with your stride rate. Then, note the beats/minute reading on your metronome and you'll know your current cadence.
<h6><strong>Step Two: Run at this Cadence for One Week</strong></h6>
Practice running with your metronome at your measured cadence for one week. Let's say for example that it's 170 strides/minute. Set your metronome to beep at that rate and start it  then you begin each run. Practice matching your cadence to the beat of the metronome with every step you take, if you can. This will train you to maintain a steady cadence no matter what your speed. That's right! Your cadence should stay the same whether you're running fast or slow, up or downhill, or trying to catch a bus. Keep it the same, no matter what and you'll learn to be a <em>highly</em> efficient runner because you'll never be caught overstriding or overworking your legs!
<h6><strong>Step Three: Increase your cadence to fall between 170-180 strides/minute</strong></h6>
Your cadence should ideally range between 170-180 strides per minute. If you're a tall or long-legged runner you could run with a cadence closer to 170 spm. If you're a short legged runner (like me) you should aim for a cadence closer to 180 spm.

Run for a week with your metronome set at whatever cadence you're starting at. Then, after a week, increase the setting on your metronome by one beat per minute and run every run for the following week at your new cadence. By upping your cadence only one beat per week, your body will barely notice the cadence increase. This gradual way of increasing your cadence is much easier on your body than trying to run at your ideal cadence right away. It gives your body time to adjust to a new way of running.
<h6><strong>Step Four: Run to a Waltz Beat</strong></h6>
Actually, this can happen during Step Three. To keep your body balanced, it is better to run with a waltz rhythm which goes like this:

<strong>Set your metronome to beep on every third foot strike. So your footsteps with the beat would go: right 2, 3…left 2, 3…right 2, 3…left 2, 3…beep 2, 3…beep 2, 3…just like a waltz.</strong>

I suggest using the waltz rhythm as soon as you have gotten through your first week of using a metronome. You can use it right after you've determined your beginning cadence. A nice added feature of this is that you don't have to listen to as many beats every minute.

Here's a conversion chart for switching to a waltz rhythm. It's a simple calculation. Take your current cadence and divide by 3.
<h6><strong>Strides per minute</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Step Five: Use Your New Cadence to Improve Your Form</strong></h6>
There is no better training tool than a metronome for learning to vary your stride length to accommodate different speeds. Once you're comfortable running with your metronome, do
this workout with the metronome set at your ideal cadence and keep it going the entire time. Warm up for 5 minutes and then run one minute intervals, without missing a beat, changing
gears every minute. You can shift gears up or down during these 1-minute intervals, but I suggest only running in your first 3 gears. One thing you can't do is vary your cadence. It's a
good challenge to allow your stride length to go longer or shorter depending on the gear you're running in.
<h6><strong>Here are the four gears:</strong></h6>
1. Warm-up pace (very easy pace)
2. Training pace (the pace you would run your longest run - aerobic)
3. Race pace (the pace you would run in a race - High-end aerobic)
4. Sprint speed (your top speed - anaerobic)
<h5><strong>The Racers Edge</strong></h5>
When I'm running competitively I trick my body into going a little faster by
raising my normal tempo of 180 up to 182. On race day I run at this slightly
faster tempo and my body hardly notices the difference. This gives me a little bit
of an edge that can make a difference in a race. Two more strides per minute
will add on about twelve additional feet per minute, which means that I can
literally drop minutes off my half marathon time without feeling any increase in
my effort level.

Aside from the metronome, it is always important to practice the basic
ChiRunning form focuses. Your core needs to be engaged and your posture
aligned. Your shoulders should be relaxed and your arms swinging easily as you
feel for the sweet spot of your lean. Do two of these form workouts each week
and you’ll have fabulous running technique in no time.

		<excerpt><![CDATA[<p>
	Your body thrives on rhythm&hellip; your heart beat, your breath rate, your love for dancing, are all based on rhythms in your body or that you&#39;ve established in your life. The more rhythms you establish, the better your body likes it.</p>
<p>
	When you&#39;re body has a rhythm to follow it doesn&#39;t work as hard. It knows what to do and when to do it. If you go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, your body experiences a rhythm... "now I get to rest, now it&#39;s time to get up."</p>
<p>
	One rhythm I&#39;m acutely aware of when I run, is my cadence&hellip;the number of strides I take per minute. I have found that most people do best when they run with a steady rhythmical cadence. It varies slightly from person to person based on height, body structure and personality type, but the optimal cadence for humans, seems to fall between 170-180 strides per minute.</p>]]></excerpt>

		<title><![CDATA[March 2019 Instructor of the Month: Jean Gillis]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<em><img class=" wp-image-6474 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/JeanGillis-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="260" /></em>I live in rural Central Massachusetts with my husband on our mini farm. When I’m not busy caring for our menagerie of animals, dogs, chickens, horses, sheep, and more, I coach athletes in groups, and 1-1, for marathons and triathlons, and I teach group fitness.

<strong>How did you start running?</strong>
I had always been active in sports, playing soccer since a young age. Then when I was in college, a friend of mine inspired me to start running road races. Once I started, I never stopped.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
I came across ChiRunning at an event expo, bought the book, and started practicing on my own for a few years. Then I decided that I wanted to get more serious about it, and really figure out if I was doing it correctly. So I participated in an all day workshop with Vince Vaccaro, one of the longest teaching instructors, in July of 2016. At this workshop it totally clicked for me and I was absolutely hooked.

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong>
Prior to practicing ChiRunning, I didn’t associate running with relaxation, and I used digging in and “muscling” to go faster. Now I’m able to go further, faster, with less effort. One of my ambitions for learning ChiRunning is to be able to run a 100 mile ultra and not suffer like I’ve seen some runners suffer. I think with ChiRunning it’s possible!

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong>
I think the biggest misconception is that ChiRunning is slow running, or something alternative that’s not for serious runners.

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>
Being outside, being self powered, exploring by foot. Keeping my mind and body feeling good. Competing in races and blowing through my mental limits.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
Coaching a 60 something year old client to run her first 5k, even though she joined the class expecting to only ChiWalk. As well as realizing my passion for endurance sports, and launching my own business. I worked in the corporate world for 15 years and got laid off. At that point I had been volunteer coaching a triathlon team for four years, and I decided to make the leap to making coaching my full time career. My business is Jean Gillis Wellness, endurance coaching.

<strong>What led you to become an Instructor?</strong>
Taking the all day workshop with Vince helped me to confirm what the technique should feel like in my body, and it felt awesome. At this time I was already coaching athletes, and I wanted to be able to share this with them, and runners everywhere!

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an Instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I know that running changes, and can even save lives. It has been shown to help people overcome things like depression, anxiety, addictions, low self esteem, and more. I feel honored to be able to introduce people to running in a way that will help them to enjoy it more and avoid injury, as well as to help injured runners come back to a sport that they love. ChiRunning started out as a way to improve my own running technique, but has now become a large part of my business, and a way that I get to connect with and support lots of cool people!

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
It depends on the time of year, but I typically run three times a week, two shorter runs, and a longer run. I enjoy mixing it up, from different technique focuses, to different surfaces, flat, hilly, trails.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
In addition to ChiRunning, I swim, indoor and outdoor, and bike. I also do strength training, and yoga.

<strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong>
Instead of seeing it as something to get done or accomplish, come at it with an attitude of exploration. ChiRunning does take practice, but it’s so worth it; particularly if you want to run long in to your years! You can learn a lot about your body just by paying attention. Rather than running through pain or discomfort, you can learn how to make the right adjustments to move more in harmony.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race you’ve run and why:</strong> <em>Stone Cat 50 mile trail run because my husband and I ran it together. Running that distance is very challenging, and it was so special that we were able to support each other through it.</em>

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> <em>Lake Placid Ironman. I appreciated every moment because I almost bailed on the race. We were moving to a new house the weekend before the race, and I felt very overwhelmed. I’m so glad I went!</em>

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> <em>50 degrees, sunny with scattered clouds.</em>

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> <em>I’m currently playing with cadence.</em>
<em>It’s helping to shorten my stride. I like alternating matching the arm swing or the ankle lift to the beat, and noticing the change in my heart rate.</em>

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> <em>In the woods</em>

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <em>Warm quinoa with a drizzle of honey, nuts, and blueberries.</em>

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> <em>Recently, I’ve been really enjoying smoothies with banana, almond milk, cocoa powder, and peanut butter.</em>

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> I run without music because I prefer to tune in to my body, breath, and surroundings.

<strong>If I didn’t run</strong> I would spend more time swimming and biking because I know that physical activity and being outside make me a happy camper!

<strong>I can’t run without</strong> first doing a little warmup of high knees, butt kicks, side shuffles.

<strong>My first marathon was</strong> <em>Boston and I had an amazing time running in memory of my mom and raising money for Ovarian Cancer.</em>

<strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is </strong><em>Altras</em>

<strong>My most difficult run ever was</strong> <em>the half marathon at the end of a half ironman triathlon and I had some tummy issues. </em>

<strong>I’ve ran</strong> <em>9 marathons/races.</em>

<strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> <strong>is </strong><em>50 miles in Massachusetts.</em>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-6951 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Harrison-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />I am a Canadian Chinese living in Hong Kong, a triathlete and marathoner. I used to operate a garment manufacturing/exporting business for 20 years, when I met ChiRunning in 2013, beside the transformation of my running experience and lifestyles, this brought me the opportunity to let me grew passionately my interest into a career. I am the regional director of the Asia Pacific region to spread ChiRunning/ChiWalking in my region.

<strong>How did you start running?</strong>
I started running in early 30s since I was alerted by my poor health condition caused by my lifestyle working as a frequently-travel businessman.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
In 2013, ChiRunning was introduced to me by a swimmer in my training group of Total Immersion®, I was then marveled by this revolutionary running technique! I found myself benefiting from ChiRunning immediately in my running and triathlon races: no more fatigue, no more pain, and a much better result under the same effort level.

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong>
ChiRunning brought me performance and efficiency in my sports, running is no longer pain and exhausted, especially in my Ironman race - the run after the bike leg. By the way, practice through focus on breathing, through Y’Chi, I started to grasp the key of running meditation, and amazingly, a few months after I started ChiRunning, I built up my body-senses and have my spine alignment and posture alerted most of the time no matter I was sitting, standing, walking or running, I could do meditation with crossed-legged for hours which I couldn't do it before. I also found that when my body has reached the moment of “cooperate with nature forces, return to innocence” and mastered the mind-body connection, running is not just a sport, but a lifestyle. There is a more profound philosophy in that.

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>Many people think ChiRunning is for slow runner and jogger since we emphasis the Relaxation. But not until they truly understand our revolutionary training way: Form, Distance, Speed in gradual progress - the correct form is built to create a good condition for speed to happen.

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>
The joy, and the health benefits.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
Becoming a Master Instructor.

<strong>What led you to become an instructor?
</strong>I believe in “The best things in life must be shared with others!”

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an Instructor, and how has it affected your life?
</strong>“Whoever teaches learns in the act of teaching, and whoever learns teaches in the act of learning.”, I found that the more I share this techniques with others, my understanding of Chi-principles gets deeper; It is my honor to shoulder the responsibility of spreading ChiRunning in the Greater China Region. (Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese internal martial art)

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?
</strong>Running 5-6 days per week, road running for an hour or two on weekdays, longer trail running on weekends, speed workout on track bi-weekly if a target race is being set.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
Swimming and Cycling

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?
</strong>If you want to run fast, first master how to run slow.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>

		<title><![CDATA[Lactic Acid & The Key to Fresh Legs]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lactic Acid &amp; The Key to Fresh Legs</strong></h2>
The word “lactic acid” seems to strike fear in the hearts of most runners. It’s gotten so much hype in running articles we’re led to believe it’s like drinking poison. So, let’s put some of those fears to rest. As a ChiRunner I rarely have to deal with the downside of lactic acid build-up, and I want every runner to experience what that’s like.

<em>Lactic acid is not the boogeyman of running.</em>
<h4><strong>What Lactic Acid Feels Like in Your Body</strong></h4>
<img class="wp-image-7128 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sore-legs-lactic-acid.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="247" />

Having an over-abundance of lactic acid in your body can present itself as cramps, weakness in the muscles and sometimes nausea. These symptoms of fatigue usually go away within a few hours if you stop exercising.

If you experience sore muscles, it’s more likely NOT lactic acid build-up, but from working your muscles beyond their current capability, which is not always a bad thing.
<h4><strong>What creates Lactic Acid build-up?</strong></h4>
Lactic acid is caused by running at an anaerobic pace where your body requires more oxygen than your lungs can provide. <strong>It is a <em>by-product </em>of anaerobic exercise, and not a <em>waste</em> product, which is what most people are led to believe.</strong> That’s because once the anaerobic period ends, the lactic acid can be broken down into useful components for the body. Here’s how it breaks down:
<ul>
 	<li>70% of lactic acid produced is oxidized and <em>used</em> by the body during aerobic exercise</li>
 	<li>20% is converted to glucose (energy) in the liver</li>
 	<li>10% is converted to protein</li>
</ul>
Your body produces lactic acid in a few different ways:

<img class="alignright wp-image-7134 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sprinters-on-track-300x276.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="276" />
<ol>
 	<li>Short, intense bursts of speed without enough oxygen available to sustain your effort</li>
 	<li>Beginning runners starting up a running program whose muscles aren't used to the workload of running</li>
 	<li>Increasing speed or distance too quickly (We suggest upgrading your training no more than 10% each week!)</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Is lactic acid a bad thing?</strong></h4>
It’s really only bad for you when there’s a build-up in your system that doesn’t get broken down by your body to be used as glucose fuel or protein. This happens when there’s not enough oxygen in your body to break it down into its usable components.
<h4><strong>How can I avoid building up too much lactic acid?</strong></h4>
The trick to not producing an over-abundance of lactic acid is to run in a way where you either don’t produce it to begin with (run aerobically) or you run in a way that allows your body to “recycle” it into useful components.

Your body burns glucose and glycogen for fuel. Glucose resides in your blood. Excess glucose is stored in your liver and muscles as glycogen, which is the basic fuel your body runs on. It is created by your consumption of carbohydrates. The process of burning glycogen is called glycolysis. There are basically two ways your body burns glycogen… either with, or without, oxygen.

When you’re sprinting or running in an anaerobic state, your body requires more oxygen than your lungs can provide. This state is only possible for a very short periods, usually seconds, with sprinters. This triggers the production of lactic acid which is a by-product of glycolysis.

The focus here is not so much how to deal with lactic acid as how to prevent its over-production in the first place. If you’re a sprinter you need to deal with it. But, if you’re a distance runner there are ways you can inhibit the production of lactic acid by remembering a few good pointers. So, what’s the hurry?

Lactic acid is produced when there is little or not enough oxygen… anaerobic exercise. This means that it will be produced <em>any time</em> your muscles are not getting enough oxygen to burn cleanly and without producing an over-abundance of lactic acid.

How many times have we all sat around a campfire that is smoking like crazy. When there is not enough oxygen delivered to the wood it doesn’t burn hot enough and usually creates tons of smoke. Then, everybody in the way of the smoke has to move or sit farther back… which defeats the whole purpose of having a nice cozy fire to begin with. Abundant smoke inevitably happens when someone puts a huge log on the fire, and there’s not enough heat to draw air into the flames. So, the fix for this is to either rearrange the fire to where there is enough oxygen to keep the log burning… or use smaller firewood!

This is very similar to someone running in a way where there’s not enough oxygen getting to their muscles. A proper burn can’t happen and efficiency drops. Interestingly enough this anaerobic state doesn’t only happen to sprinters, but happens in distance runners who <em>run</em> <em>inefficiently</em> or <em>breathe</em> <em>inefficiently</em>. For many runners it can be both.
<h5><strong>Work on your running efficiency</strong></h5>
<img class=" wp-image-5174 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/img_0800_15618382076_o-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="389" />When you run inefficiently you’re using more energy to move your body than is necessary. Poor biomechanics, muscle tension and even mental tension keeps your body from moving as smoothly as it would if these problems didn’t exist. But they do. And, our job as mindful ChiRunners is to be watchful and body sense what we might be doing to <em>contribute</em> to our own fatigue, and then do what we can to eliminate these trouble spots. The most basic principles of ChiRunning teach runners and walkers how to move in a way that dissipates tension, improves ease of motion, and reduces impact. In ChiRunning, you don’t work as hard to run, so you can actually <em>reduce</em> your body’s workload at any speed, and not require as much oxygen.

<img class="alignright wp-image-7139" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/runner-taking-a-break-to-breathe-hands-above-head-185x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="409" />

A simple way (and you’ve heard it forever) is to warm up slowly and be sure to cool down at a slow pace as well. This allows your body, at the start of your runs, to gradually adjust to the sudden increase in the demand for oxygen. At the end of your runs, it allows your body the time to break down any residual lactic acid in your system. If you don’t do a cool-down jog or walk, it could extend this time to hours, or days if you’ve done a hard workout.
<h5><strong>Work on improving your oxygen uptake while running</strong></h5>
The main cause of lactic acid build-up is running in an anaerobic state, where your lungs aren’t producing enough O<sub>2</sub> for glycolysis to happen in your muscles. Changing how you breathe can have a huge effect on this problem.

A recent trend in training for runners is to improve one’s oxygen uptake through nose breathing. In his book, <em>The Oxygen Advantage, </em>Patrick McKeown talks about the importance of nose breathing and how it works to build a more extensive and efficient delivery system of oxygen to the muscles. In short it’s a great way to get your body to become more tolerant to CO<sub>2, </sub>which is the molecule responsible for transporting O<sub>2 </sub>to your muscles. When you chest-breathe and mouth-breathe (as sprinters do) you breathe in excess oxygen and breathe out too much carbon dioxide. This can starve your lungs of oxygen and increase the workload to your heart and lungs as well as your chest and neck muscles.

For distance runners, nose breathing trains you to breathe more slowly and deeply so you can take more advantage of the CO<sub>2  </sub>transfer system and get more oxygen to your muscles with each breath. In the end you learn to breathe less to accomplish more.

As you combine highly efficient running technique with higher quality breathing practices, you won’t have to go through all the lactic acid build-up and elimination cycles that most other runners have to deal with. You won’t “hit the wall” or get muscle cramps because the lactic acid in your system will never me beyond your body’s ability to eliminate it as you run.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[7 Yoga Poses for ChiRunners]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>7 Yoga Poses for ChiRunners</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga is the perfect complement to ChiRunning. In a regular yoga practice, you'll expand the mindfulness of ChiRunning into your recovery and cross-training. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning's foundation in t’ai chi, an ancient physical, mental and energetic practice, makes running not just a sport and a way to keep healthy, but a mind-body practice to gain self-knowledge.  In ChiRunning you learn to Body Sense, carefully listening to your body and always moving with the primary precepts of injury prevention and energy efficiency as the foundation of each run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga, too, is an ancient practice to discover and explore the physicality and energies of body, mind and spirit. Different asanas, or yoga poses, are an opportunity to experience the inner structure of your body and being, and to discover where you feel strength, fluidity and balance, as well as weakness, tension and imbalance. It’s a great way to get to know your capacities and your limits, physically and energetically and gentle expanding those boundaries.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7214" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/yoga-beauty-shot.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="705" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In t’ai chi, ChiRunning and in yoga, the practice is to become aware without responding impulsively.  First deepen your awareness by paying close attention, move into acceptance of where you are in the moment and then perhaps make gentle, informed  adjustments to get more stability and more flow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrupt changes can be harmful to the body and hurtful to the psyche. Trying to go deeper into an asana before your body is ready can cause damage, just as pushing too hard to run faster can cause injury. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To prep your body for a run we recommend warming up with our Body Looseners which are specifically designed for ChiRunning.  After a run, we suggest you do the following yoga poses, preferably right after, but anytime after is beneficial. Yoga is also the perfect cross-training for the days you don’t run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga helps activate muscles and joints, increases your flexibility, and helps you relax, which is at the heart of ChiRunning: a strong core with everything else loose and responsive.  In ChiRunning, as in yoga, relaxation is what allows you to move fluidly, with ease and grace. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga strengthens and tones your body while it also gently stretches tight muscles. Conscious belly breathing is also a practice that both disciplines share. And, of course, both yoga and ChiRunning ask you to be present with your body and all the feelings that arise while practicing. Frustration, pride, joy or emptiness are all human experiences that offer a window into our deeper nature. </span>

<strong>These 7 poses offer a short yoga practice that is a great complement to ChiRunning. <em>Not all of these are beginner poses, so take your time and find alternatives if it is too much for your body.</em></strong>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">7 Pilates Exercises to Improve Your Running</h1>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/amelia-vrabel/">Amelia Vrabel, Senior Instructor</a>
Colorado Springs/Denver, CO</em></strong></h5>
<a href="#section1">View 7 Pilates Exercise to Improve Your Running</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest things I love about ChiRunning is that it’s thrown the whole concept of “no pain, no gain” out the window. (Seriously - that’s so, like 1985!) By working with the forces of nature and engaging your mind </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> body to move forward, running becomes a mindful and enjoyable whole body movement that promotes health and wellness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A key area of focus as a ChiRunner or ChiWalker is to maintain proper alignment and posture throughout the movement. The core muscles are engaged to stabilize the body each time the foot lands on the ground and when the body is in the flight phase of the stride as well. . </span>
<h5>Consciously Engaging Core Muscles in Pilates &amp; ChiRunning</h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Certified ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructor, I have found that for many it’s not that they lack the core strength to hold themselves in proper alignment, but rather that they have forgotten how and when to engage the strong, stabilizing muscles of their core. Once upon a time as children, we naturally engaged our core muscles, but years of sitting behind desks, in front of televisions, and driving in cars has nullified our innate use of these muscles– that includes when we run as well. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In both Pilates and ChiRunning, we are mindfully and consciously learning to bring these crucial, stabilizing muscles back into your movement habits. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I use classical Pilates to  complement my ChiRunning practice because they share many fundamental principles: </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whole body and mindful movement</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper body alignment</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelvic stability</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core engagement</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focused, intentional movement. </span></li>
</ul>
<h5>Moving Mindfully with Pilates</h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been practicing classical Pilates regularly now for several years. I’m fortunate to have fantastic teachers and a lovely studio (Whole Living Pilates in Colorado Springs, check it out!) that affords the opportunity to work on different types of apparatus (mat, reformer, chair, spine corrector, tower, etc.). With each movement the focus is never how far you can go or how hard you can work, it’s about doing the movement correctly and learning the feeling within your body (Body Sensing!). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, Pilates is a lot like ChiRunning. It doesn’t matter how far or fast you can run, the point is doing so efficiently, with good posture, and paying attention to how your body feels.  In Pilates and ChiRunning, the point is to create healthy, positive movement habits. You don’t push harder until you can maintain that proper movement for the duration. It is way better to move smoothly and correctly and from there, you can progress in your strength building or your running distance without fear of pain or injury. </span>
<h5>Whole Body Movement</h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In both practices, you maintain a sense of where your pelvis is in space, how to stay tall with good posture, and how to feel your core engaged.  You’ll feel your body moving as one whole unit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pilates, the fun movement challenge is to feel this cohesive body movement from various positions.  Ultimately all this varied practice helps you find your core while you’re running or no matter what you’re doing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Pilates I practice Body Sensing that I then bring into my ChiRunning practice. I’m either lying on the mat and really reaching through the crown of my head, feeling my core engage, and keeping my pelvis level as we perform a Pilates exercise. Or,  I’m on the roads or trails also reaching through the crown of my head and feeling my core engage as I fall forward and catch myself with my next foot strike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s never one body part acting alone - it’s mind and body fully integrated and connected throughout the practice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s “no pain, ALL gain!"</span>

		<title><![CDATA[July 2019 Instructor of the Month: Sarah Richardson]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-7340 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_2.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="519" />I currently live in Vermont with my awesome husband Mike, who is also a runner and athlete of all kinds. We have a super fluffy cat named Pumpkin and I have the pleasure of being a step-mom to two inspiring women, one here in Vermont and the other over on the West Coast in LA. We have a sprawling piece of property on Lake Champlain where we host a few Summer ChiRunning Camps and wind down our days enjoying the sunsets. I grew up on the south shore of Long Island and although it was within an hour of New York City, it was very rural and nature was easily accessible. Our home was across the street from a 2,500 acre wildlife refuge and a 6 minute boat ride to the ocean. I had easy access to miles of trails, beaches and wide open spaces. My love for the outdoors began there. Horses, beaches and running were my passions during my school years and kept my mind and body sound. I attended the Audubon Expedition Institute, an experiential program for Graduate School, and traveled the country exploring social, educational, and environmental issues. It was an incredible way to see and learn about the US, camping out every night under the stars and hiking a LOT of backcountry. I fell in love with teaching during that time and then attended The College of St. Rose where I received a Masters in Education with a focus on Special Education. That’s when my official teaching career began (2000-ish). Currently, I’m a Special Educator at a local high school, U-32, where I head the Transition Academy. It’s a program for students between the ages of 17-22 with intensive needs and profound disabilities, both physical and intellectual. It is a very rewarding position and has made me an even more compassionate and patient human being. And it compliments my role as a ChiRunning instructor because it is effortless for me to differentiate instruction. I can meet people wherever they are, and break content down to very understandable concepts and deliver it in multi-sensory ways. So if you think you can’t learn how to ChiRun or fall in love running again.. Let me have a try! I can guarantee I’ll figure out a way for it to happen!!!!

<strong>How did you start running?
</strong>Running has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. When we were little, if my brother and I fought, my mom would have us run 5 laps around the house. By the second lap we would be laughing and best friends again. When I was 5 I ran my first race! My friend’s dad was a track coach and he brought us to the Colgate Women’s Games in NYC. I came in dead last! But it was my first experience with the intensity and excitement of the sport and it was awesome! I remember cheering for people all day after I ran. I was hooked!!!!!

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
After running for 30 years with very few injuries, I literally stumbled into an acute injury. During an adventure race, I fell in a pothole and twisted my ankle pretty bad. I chose to finish that leg and a third leg afterwards. I rested for a while after that to recover, but for the next 3 years I was plagued by a host of injuries, which were new to my body, and it sucked the fun out of running. Hip issues, hamstring issues, and metatarsal discomfort... In order to figure it out, I went to a ChiRunning clinic with Danny in Boston and before the end of the day, I was “cured.” I knew why my body was responding the way it was and experienced immediate relief and was able to get back to running! By the end of the day I was so happy and asked how I could teach it to other people because it was just BRILLIANT!!!

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?
</strong>I was never a fast or competitive runner. I always loved the peacefulness and calm it brought to my mind. It was really nice to meet other people who thought of running in the same terms and wanted to take care of their bodies through running rather than use their running as a punishment or a short term goal. Upon meeting Danny and other ChiRunning Instructors/ChiRunners I knew I had met my tribe. They are my people! What changed was I felt validated for my beliefs about running.

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>That you don’t need it or it doesn’t apply to you. There is a misconception from struggling or beginning runners that they aren’t good enough yet to need a running coach or advice on their running. And there is a misconception from highly competitive runners that they already know it all and would not benefit from ChiRunning because it doesn’t promote pushing harder. I hear both of these judgments regularly and I believe they are short sighted because I’ve worked with people who would fit into both groups, and every client I’ve worked with who has gotten through all of the content has said that it’s the best thing they’ve done for their running.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7339" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_1.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="439" />

<strong>What motivates you to run?
</strong>Being outside, feeling good in my body. I love to feel strong, accomplished and clear in my head. I crave the calming effect running has on my mind and body. When I was injured I didn’t know how much running regulated my body, because I had never not run before. But there I was, not able to run and became plagued by anxiety to the point of being medicated. As soon as it I was able to run consistently again I was able to ditch the medication and self-regulate through running.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
I have 7 full marathons, 7 halves and countless 5k/10k’s under my belt and I’m super proud that I’m still running, safely and soundly for the past 5 years! It was awful to be injured and I’m glad I got the help from ChiRunning when I needed it. I actually wish I had done it sooner. Asking for help is a strength and something to be proud of!!!
<p dir="ltr">The publication of my book From Sidelines to Start Lines: The Frustrated Runner’s Guide to Lacing Up for a Lifetime. It’s a self-help book for struggling runners and gives practical strategies to go along with the ChiRunning technique that help you get back into running. My coaching programs are based on it and integrate mindset, lifestyle and form for a well rounded holistic approach to running.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having a story published in Chicken Soup for the Soul: Running for Good. It just came out in June, 2019 so it’s fresh on my mind!!!</p>
<strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong>
The minute I attended my first clinic I was hooked. I KNEW I wasn’t the only runner who was frustrated and going crazy not being able to run because of an injury. I’ve been able to take back my life through the sport of running and want to help others do the same. And it all makes so much sense from a technical standpoint! ChiRunning is a concept/technique that I can wholeheartedly stand behind. Who wouldn’t want to become more efficient and experience fewer injuries???? The teacher in me knew I had to learn it and share it.

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I’m a teacher through and through. Runners are super cool and ask great questions. I love helping people and especially love seeing the “lightbulb” go on when they get it. It’s my mission to facilitate as many, “A-ha,” moments as I can! Plus, I always learn so much from each runner I work with, which makes me a better person and a better teacher of the content. Being a ChiRunning instructor has also taken me to different parts of the world. I have assisted Danny at Kripalu in Massachusetts and in NYC, I’ve taught clinics in Dallas, TX, hosted retreats in Vermont, and I’m introducing the ChiRunning concepts at a Women’s Retreat in Fiji in 2020! Super exciting!!!

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
I’m an early riser and enjoy getting my runs in just after dawn (or before dawn during the winter). I like to do “something” every day. My typical week has me running on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I walk on Tuesdays and Fridays and I reserve Sundays for whatever I feel like! It could be a mountain bike ride, a fun run or just a leisurely hike out in the woods. My typical run is between 40-60 minutes.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
I like all things outdoors… Mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, walking, and skate skiing in the winter. I have to say that I do all of these with more efficiency, confidence and strength since becoming a ChiRunner. Many of the form focuses have a positive impact on other activities &amp; sports! Body sensing is a life changer and has kept me sound across the spectrum.

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong>
Listen to your body! Learn to love the messages it gives you. Allow yourself to develop a relationship with yourself. When you’re first learning, take it one form focus at a time and continue to work on it until your body begins to automates it. Be open to and feel the shift, then thank your body for adapting. Our bodies are designed to heal. When we set up the conditions for it to do so, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can change! Notice these changes and celebrate!
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race and why:</strong> The Boilermaker, Utica, NY. Saranac rewards the neighborhood that provides the most support to runners with block party, so the crowd of spectators for the whole 15k is incredible. It is awesome to be in the midst of 13,000 runners feeling like each community member is cheering for you. And the ice pops (and beer) at the end are awesome!

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> The Honolulu Marathon. It was my first full and I just LOVED it! The training, the race and the vacation changed my life! And I still have the tattoo to prove it!!!

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> A light rain that starts just <i>after </i>I'm<i> </i>warmed up!

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Landing on and maintaining my tripod because I still have a tendency to roll to the outside of my left foot since the pothole incident. And Cadence, always cadence!!!!!

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> The trails on Isle La Motte in Vermont. And I especially love to run while on vacation. Running has allowed me to see so much of the world and in such an intimate way.

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> A Buttered Hard Roll with poppy seeds on top from Stewarts (Upstate New Yorkers will know)

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> It doesn’t matter… Anything!!!!

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Island Vines 10k this September, RaceVermont Fall Half in November. In 2020 my goal is to run the New England Series (6 Half Marathons in 6 Days) and a trail Ultra.

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> No music. No earbuds.

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> I don’t use a playlist. Just the beeping of a metronome!!!]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Chi Insider on Barefoot Running, Minimalist Running & Natural Running]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2><b>Barefoot Running, Minimalist Running, Natural Running – ChiRunning Supports it All</b></h2>
<h5><b>Why has barefoot running become an important topic in the running community?</b></h5>
<img class="alignright wp-image-7362" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/runner-on-road-barefoot-with-shoes-beside-him.jpg" alt="Close up legs of man with black running shoes on asphalt road in morning time" width="452" height="282" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Barefoot running is obviously not a new idea... I’m sure cavemen and women did it. But, growing popularity of barefoot and minimalist running has rocked the running world in recent years, partially because of the success of the Kenyans and other African runners who have shown that growing up running barefoot has helped them establish world-class results in every distance from the 10K to the marathon. Barefoot running has led to the burgeoning minimalist shoe industry and has caused many of the “old guard” shoe companies to rethink shoe design from the ground up. And, as barefoot/minimal running gains more traction, there are also reports of injuries from barefoot running that need to be kept in mind. </span>
<h5><b>Barefoot running and natural running</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running with no shoes, or in a minimalist shoe, allows your feet to move and flex in a more natural way than when they’re strapped into a sometimes confined space that can be stiff, constricted, too heavy or too thick, which is how too many running shoes are designed. When your feet can move freely as you run, it allows your entire body to settle into a more natural and easier way to move. In many ChiRunning classes, I’ve asked the students to take off their shoes and briefly run up and down the track. What I immediately see is a very different group of runners than I was witnessing only moments before. Their knees are more bent. They’re not over-striding and heel striking. They’re lighter on their feet. Their stride shortens and their cadence is quicker. This is the way humans were designed to run. And, what I have known for about 25 years, is that some of the time it’s the shoes that are making it more difficult for people to feel the ease they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have with their running.</span>
<h5><b>What are the benefits of barefoot running? </b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning is about teaching you how to run barefoot-like, as if you had run barefoot or in minimal shoes your whole life. The barefoot running concept came about, in part, when we began to observe that lifelong barefoot runners are generally  more efficient and have excellent running technique. The Tarahumara runners of Mexico, who run multi-day races in huarache sandals, were mentioned in Chris McDougall’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born to Run</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These runners, like the Kenyans spend most of their lives running barefoot, or in minimalist shoes, and both cultures have the stride mechanics that runners envy. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-7365" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/couple-smiling-running-on-beach-happy-barefoot.jpg" alt="exercising running couple jogging on beach. runners training on sand by the ocean smiling happy in full body length. interracial fit fitness couple, asian woman and caucasian man runner." width="615" height="411" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running barefoot, or in minimal shoes, means you have no cushioning on the soles of your feet. This forces you to use a shorter stride and a higher cadence to accommodate for the lack of protection on your feet. A shorter stride length keeps you from overstriding or heel striking. The lack of cushioning encourages plantar flexion and a forefoot/midfoot strike which also reduces impact.</span>
<h5><b>Is running barefoot, or in minimal shoes, better for you?</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how you run, it might be better and it might not. The way I’ve always approached the running shoe dilemma is to try to convince runners that if you can learn to run barefoot-like, you’ll be better off than most runners regardless of the shoes you wear. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with barefoot running today is that adults, who have never run barefoot, have been led to believe that if they too run barefoot, they will gain the benefits other barefoot runners enjoy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work that way. Many barefoot runners are getting injured because their running technique does not improve and change as quickly as they had hoped, or were led to believe. Years of sitting at desks and wearing inappropriate shoes can leave us with ingrained body habits that take time to change. Patience in this situation is not only a good idea, it’s the law. Your body needs time to change and adapt to a new way of moving and it’s not a process you can rush.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Barefoot running does not automatically change all those years of habits. And, unfortunately for some, not necessarily quickly enough to stave off injury. The concept of barefoot running has shown us that there is a basic, running technique natural to the human form. ChiRunning is about taking you back to that natural running technique through a series of exercises and technique focuses that you can mindfully practice. That’s why we call it “barefoot-like” running, and it’s been proven to reduce impact and improve your running economy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a very perceptive quote from Dan Liebermann, a professor in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, who has studied, and written extensively about barefoot running.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How one runs probably is more important than what is on one’s feet, but what is on one’s feet may affect how one runs.”</span></blockquote>
<img class=" wp-image-7368 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/67023673_s.jpg" alt="Two athletes runners couple running together on beach. People from behind jogging away barefoot on sand on tropical travel destination. Lower body, legs, feet." width="552" height="368" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parts of Liebermann’s statement are true. I’m a big believer that if you can run (or walk) with an efficient, low-impact style, it doesn’t matter </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what’s on your feet. So, as  I sit down to write this article, I find myself not so much writing about barefoot running per se, as about the case for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">practicing good running habits.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the important points about barefoot running I’ve gleaned from reading many studies* comparing running barefoot, or minimal shoes, to running in conventional shoes. I’ve also added in what I’ve learned from coaching countless runners of all abilities and body types.</span>

<img class=" wp-image-7382 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ChiRunning-Testimonial-by-Randy-K.-Barefoot-runner.png" alt="" width="696" height="232" />
<h6><b>Benefits of running barefoot or in minimalist shoes</b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthens the intrinsic muscles in your ankles and lower legs (this is good if you have structural or muscular weakness in your lower legs, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as good if you have normal or over-developed lower legs)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improves the range of motion (ROM) of your ankles and Achilles tendons</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can possibly help you transition from a heel strike to a midfoot/forefoot strike (but not guaranteed)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps increase knee flexion during the landing and support phases of your stride (lower impact)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps shorten your stride and increase your cadence (which reduces over-striding, a main cause of increased load rates and impact) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows you to sneak up on someone quickly!</span></li>
</ul>
<h6><b>Things to be aware of running barefoot or in minimalist shoes</b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as possible, relax your lower legs so that if you plantar flex upon landing, you don’t stiffen your ankles and actually create more impact. This will help prevent metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis which can happen with runners not used to running barefoot or in minimalist shoes.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running barefoot, or in minimal shoes feels awesome, but can lead to injury if you don’t take the time to transition slowly and allow your feet and legs to adapt.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When downhill running you should maintain a shorter stride length and a higher cadence to reduce impact.</span></li>
</ul>
<h6><b>The advantages of learning ChiRunning (barefoot-like running)<img class="alignright wp-image-7370" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Sandpit1ANIMATION.gif" alt="danny dreyer demonstrating sandpit exercise in front of group of chirunners" width="320" height="427" /></b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can run safely in most running shoes especially shoes that are light-weight, flexible, lightly cushioned, comfortable, foot-shaped and with less than 7mm drop.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your running economy becomes less dependent on the shoes you wear (heavier running shoes are the exception).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have a healthy running technique that will serve you well for the rest of your life.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You become more mindful in your running practice which leads to constant improvement. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to run barefoot or in minimalist (or zero-drop) shoes without fear of injury.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you run, you strengthen only the muscles that need to be strengthened which allows you to accomplish more… while relaxing more.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your shoes last longer so you don’t spend as much of your hard-earned money on shoes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply said, if you run with less impact and less muscle stress, you’ll have fewer injuries. Which is what we mainly focus on in </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning workshops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in all our </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h5><b>The case for wearing more minimal shoes</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My description of the best shoe for you is: </span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">least</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of shoe you can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">run in, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">given the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you currently run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the longest distance you currently run.” </span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that if you have a good, efficient, low-impact running style, you can get away with  wearing less of a shoe for a longer distance. On the other hand, if your running style is heavy, high-impact, and/or high-effort, you might need a more supportive or cushioned shoe, and have to run less mileage until your technique improves. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over-built running shoes have too much drop from heel to toe. Some shoe companies are now designing shoes with less of a drop, or no drop at all called zero-drop shoes. Zero-drop shoes can range from minimal sole thickness (4mm), up to over 30mm thick. In this case, more is not better. Remember they still have to allow your feet to flex. Having too thick of a sole on a shoe can leave you less sensitive to how you’re connecting to the ground. </span>

<img class=" wp-image-7373 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Danny-and-Lisa-demonstrating-at-denver-workshop-1.png" alt="" width="385" height="516" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a minimalist shoe, a lightly cushioned zero-drop shoe, or barefoot, it’s easy to tell when you’re landing wrong or pushing off too much. That’s because with less shoe you can actually feel what your feet and legs are doing. ChiRunning and ChiWalking classes focus a lot on Body Sensing, which increases your ability to sense what’s going on in your feet as well as the movement patterns in your body. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As your technique improves, your taste in running shoes will naturally change to less of a shoe, which means more flexibility and overall freedom for your feet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running well can mean the end of most repetitive motion injuries caused by poor mechanics. Whether or not you decide to try barefoot/minimalist running, we always suggest you proceed with caution and allow your body to transition over an extended period of time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I always urge runners to improve their running technique instead of trusting their shoes to make the difference. We never like to see people gambling with their running, whether they’re beginners or elites. </span>

		<title><![CDATA[Running After Sixty: The How & Why]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>Running After Sixty: The How &amp; Why</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been running since 1971. That was the year when this 21-year-old Colorado boy got drafted and sent away to boot camp in California. As I entered the Army I started running to maintain some semblance of sanity in a military world that was completely foreign to me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, 48 years and running, and a hundred thousand miles later, I still rely on my running to smooth the edges of my busy business, <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/">travel, teaching and speaking schedule</a>. It has never disappointed. Running is still key to my physical and mental health, and provides me with the energy to garden, kayak, cook and enjoy life to the fullest. <img class="wp-image-7337 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ron-huntsberger-testy-1.jpg" alt="danny with two other runners from ChiRunning Training Group after the Asheville Marathon" width="364" height="364" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the decades I’ve witnessed my body change from being totally out of shape when I started running in my 20’s, to cruising along in my 30’s, to racing ultramarathons in my 40’s, to running full and half marathons in my 50’s and 60’s, and still with a lot of ease and enjoyment. I  love to train for events and I still podium regularly in my age group, which has gotten pretty easy considering how few runners compete after turning 60. Many ChiRunners are running well into their 80’s. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since my 40’s, the one thing that has been consistent is my use of technique to make running easier and healthier for my whole body.</span>
<h5><strong>The Benefits of Running as You Age</strong></h5>
<strong>The risks of running are mitigated with good technique. The benefits out-weigh the risks by a long shot. Here’s the short list of great reasons to run after 60:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improves memory and brain function¹
</strong>Don't lose your quick wit as you age! The more you exercise, the more "fit" your brain becomes, especially your memory centers. Even a single run can change the way your brain functions almost instantly. <strong>
<img class="wp-image-7421 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/brain.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="283" />
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Helps to prevent age-related muscle loss²
</strong></strong>Less physical activity is common among older people, which is the biggest contributing factor to deteriorating skeletal muscle. This leads to countless other health issues and, ultimately, the loss of independence as you age. <span class="bard-text-block style-scope">Follow the old adage: </span><span class="bard-text-block style-scope">"Use it or lose it!"</span><strong><strong>
</strong></strong><img class=" wp-image-7424" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-man-running-with-young-female.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="336" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Boosts your immune system³
</strong>Not only does physical activity reduce chronic diseases as you age, but it also helps prevent viral and bacterial infections by boosting your immune system. As you age, so does your immune system, but frequent exercise can delay the aging process of your immune function too! <strong>
<img class=" wp-image-7433 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/109847314_s.jpg" alt="Senior man and woman and young female instructor workout on fresh air. Outdoor activities, healthy lifestyle, strong bodies, fit figures. Stylish, modern sportswear. Different generations" width="503" height="336" />
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Promotes good heart health<sup>4
</sup></strong>Aerobic exercise, like running, is the best thing you can do to strengthen your heart! The benefits don't stop there: A healthy heart means better blood flow to all parts of your body. <strong><sup>
<img class=" wp-image-7430 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/47633391_s.jpg" alt="sport woman touch on hand watch health application" width="503" height="336" /></sup></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Helps to build stronger bones<sup>5
</sup></strong></strong>In recent studies, high-impact endurance activities, like running, have outperformed resistance training when it comes to prevention of bone density loss. While it may see counterintuitive, the skeletal sites that receive stress from exercise, become stronger.<strong><strong>
</strong></strong><img class=" wp-image-7426" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-pointing-to-her-smile–-strong-bones.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="336" /></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Improves balance<sup>6
</sup></strong></strong>ChiRunning is derived from T'ai Chi, a practice that's proven to improve balance. The combination of the two is like being balanced in motion. Adults 60 and over begin to struggle with their balance, but the more you challenge it, the more you strengthen it! <strong><strong><sup>
</sup></strong></strong><img class="wp-image-7428 " src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-practicing-tai-chi-in-park-balancing-on-one-foot.jpg" alt="calm barefoot athletic senior woman performing yoga balancing exercises on one leg at outdoor park with green grass and copy space" width="503" height="336" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Promotes healthy, happy knees<sup>7
</sup></strong>Many people think that running ruins your knees. New studies show that running can actually benefit these joints! Even better news: With ChiRunning, you actually take all the "heavy lifting" off your knees and take high-impact out of the equation.<strong><sup>
<img class="wp-image-7432 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/active-older-couple-kneels-to-drink-water-and-talk-.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="335" />
</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking care of your brain, as well as your body, becomes even more important after 60 and can help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slow the onset of Alzheimer’s and dementia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<sup>8</sup> Brain health, along with your physical health, should be right on top of your to-do list as you age. The focuses of ChiRunning help develop new neural pathways between your brain and your body. In recent years neuroplasticity has been tied to aging. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt and organize around input from life. It is also the brain’s job to delete unused neural pathways that no longer serve. Promoting healthy new neural pathways is what ChiRunning provides through mindful movement.</span>
<h5>How to Optimize Running in Your Sixties:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Always work on running with good technique</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practicing good, efficient, low-impact running is the best replacement for dwindling muscle mass. Aging<img class="wp-image-7460 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/danny-with-two-aging-runners-after-a-private-chirunning-workshop.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="340" /> requires us to run with more finesse and less brute force. That finesse will come from focusing on being highly efficient in your running and walking regardless. Paying consistent attention to your technique will pay off in spades as you age. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ChiRunning technique strengthens your core, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">engages your mind</span>¹<span style="font-weight: 400;">, improves your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heart health</span><sup>4</sup><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bone density</span><sup>5</sup><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> balance</span><sup>6</sup><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and helps you get out the door on a regular basis to nourish body and soul.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Adjust your ChiRunning form
</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Always maintain proper postural alignment:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years of sitting at a desk, driving a car or poor postural habits can leave older folks (and even some younger ones) with too much curvature in their thoracic spine. You can address this by standing tall and counteracting the constant downward pull of gravity. Lifting at the crown of your head straightens your spine which supports your body (<a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/">ChiRunning School Lesson #1</a>) and helps you move in a more unified way. Having great posture can also make you feel lighter on your feet.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Shorten your stride:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the easiest thing to do whenever your legs or lungs are feeling stressed. It quickly lowers impact and makes it easier to manage your energy output when you're on flat ground or going up hills.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Relax and lengthen your stride on downhills:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you age, it’s crucial to maintain a good range of motion (ROM) in your joints, especially your hips and lower back. This is best done with one of my favorite ChiRunning skills: Passive Pelvic Rotation (<a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/">ChiRunning School Lesson #17</a>), for two reasons: 1.) To create a shock-absorbing effect, directing the impact away from my knees, hips and lower back. 2.) To maintain good ROM as I allow my hip flexors, quads, and lower legs to extend behind me with each stride.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Learn active pelvic rotation:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is an advanced ChiRunning focus where your obliques drive your hips, which in turn drive your legs (<a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/">ChiRunning School Lesson #22</a>). The better you get at this valuable technique, the less you use your legs for propulsion, and the stronger your core feels. Balance and stability are the two most important benefits of engaging these deep core muscles. I use Active Pelvic Rotation running uphill… or if I want to sustain a faster pace on the flats.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>It's okay to slow down</strong>
Actually, it’s not only okay, it’s the law. As we age, both men and women produce less testosterone, a key building block of muscle mass. This creates a natural slowing of the muscle synapses which in turn restricts your speed. I can’t avoid getting slower as I age but I have been able to slow down the <i>rate </i>at which I’m losing speed by doing strength training (resistance work) or short speed intervals. <span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the slowing down process doesn’t have to begin as early as some people think. I hear 45-year-olds talking about their body slowing down. And there is truth in that. At 45 you’re no longer 25. But, we hear many, many stories of people getting faster from ChiRunning... at every age.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li><strong><strong><strong>Make running as easy as possible with run-walk intervals<img class="alignright wp-image-3460" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-walking-on-dock-in-front-of-mountains-ChiRunningGet-StartedChiWalk-Runner.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="367" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Run-walk as needed</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good technique and using our Chi Walk-Run technique means you can rest as needed. There’s no law that says you can’t stop and walk in the middle of a run. Walk when you feel you need to recover your breath, drink water or take a break. I really enjoy pausing in the midst of beautiful surroundings or expansive views. I put no pressure on myself to keep running at all costs, and I allow myself opportunities to give my body a reset by taking walking breaks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/chiwalk-run/">ChiWalk-Run program</a> is perfect for beginning runners (yes, even if you’re 60+ years old) and perfect for anyone who wants to continue to run but with more rest breaks. In the ChiWalk-Run program, you learn the keys to transitioning between walking and running by maintaining good technique in both.</span></strong></strong></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Listen to your body without judgment </strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a true act of surrender and acceptance to just “be with what is” in your running. Nothing is good or bad. It’s just information that needs to be responded to and learned from… nothing else. Always ask yourself, “What’s the best ChiRunning focus I can use right now, given my current challenge?” Keep a kind, appreciative attitude towards your body. It works wonders when you’re feeling challenged.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I see way too many people dropping out of running in their later years and there’s no need to if you practice good technique and allow your body to slow down a bit. You can’t stop the aging process, but you can slow it down by taking a positive and smart approach to being with what is. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<strong>Running after sixty can be less challenging than you’d think, and a fabulous, life-extending learning opportunity.</strong>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Why I Walk Every Day</b></h2>
<em><strong>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The number one reason I walk every day is simple: because many years of experience have taught me how much better I feel when I walk.  A day without walking is truly like a day without sunshine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since walking is low impact (with high benefits) it is safe to walk every day and by doing so, you establish a healthy habit that becomes part of your routine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In T’ai Chi and in Chinese Medicine energy that gets stuck is what causes pain, fatigue and even illness. The more I feel this in my own body, the more I want to walk which helps keep energy flowing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the clear benefits became obvious to me, walking became an absolute priority. Nothing compares with a 40-minute walk to set the stage for a great day, except maybe running. But I’m generally a walker. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t want to:<img class="alignright wp-image-3258" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/group-of-women-chiwalking-with-katherine-dreyer-ChiLivingChi-FitnessChi-Walk-Run.jpg" alt="" width="423" height="320" /></span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have more energy</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel clear and balanced emotionally</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a more focused mind</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stave off cold or flu  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep aches and pains at bay? </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I walk every day because good energy is everything to me. Creating positive, flowing energy is the best way for me to really enjoy life. On my walks, I almost always stop and do about 10 minutes of Qigong. Wow, is that the perfect combo.</span>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><b>Fair Weather or Any Weather Walking</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, getting into nature, breathing fresh air, feeling the change of seasons and enjoying every kind of weather is deeply and profoundly enlivening to the spirit. Did you know that the worst air pollution is indoors? Everyone needs more time outside. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I walk every day, I know that many people are fair-weather-walkers. If it’s the perfect day, there are many more people out running and walking, but come the cold or rain, I have the trail practically to myself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have the right gear for heat, cold, rain, and snow. A windy storm with thunder and lightning is my only true deterrent. Walking is my sunshine, even when it’s raining. Besides, I love the rain. Walking in the rain makes me feel like a kid again. </span>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><b>ChiWalking Helps Heal Injuries</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-4301 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/man-and-woman-chiwalking.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="348" />Before I walked every day, I walked 3-4 times a week, but still had some low back trouble over the years. By walking every day not only have I staved off back pain, but I’ve also healed some foot and Achilles tendonitis problems too. Not only do I feel better, but I have a deep sense of confidence in myself and my body. Since I’ve been walking every day, I am healthier than I’ve ever been in my life. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It took me a long time, but I can now walk with the most minimal shoes. The first year I tried, I went too minimal too fast and got the Achilles tendonitis problem. I’ve also had plantar fasciitis. In both cases, I knew I needed to work on my technique even more, so I did. I learned to relax my lower legs even more and eliminate any push off. I still practice all the ChiWalking form focuses for the same reason I walk; because they feel so good. </span>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><b>Multi-tasking while Walking</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While walking I meditate, practice various breathing techniques, improve my balance on curbs on the road. Walking dates are one way I keep up with my friends as well. <img class="wp-image-7496 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/walking-group.jpg" alt="group of chiwalkers with danny dreyer walk happily on a concrete pathway " width="509" height="279" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At 59 there are many things I have had to reduced significantly: chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, GMO wheat products, red meat, even popcorn no longer agrees with me. I still indulge now and then, but having reduced these so-called pleasures, as me and my girlfriends have discussed…at least we know we can still walk and breathe, walk and breathe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I do miss maybe one or two days a month and when I do, I’m acutely aware that something vital is missing.  Mostly I have an energetic experience of being sluggish, tending a bit more toward irritability, and generally feel less present with myself. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of walking are well documented and the list almost endless. But reading about those benefits and actually experiencing and living with them is as different as reading about an orange versus biting into its live, sweet juiciness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start with 3-4 days a week you’ll soon experience some significant differences and maybe want more; more energy, more fresh air, more satisfaction, more movement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits are incalculable in terms of longevity and quality of life. From lowering the risk of cancer and heart disease to greatly reducing depression and the risk of diabetes, it is truly the miracle cure everyone is looking for. </span>

<strong>Add a little Chi to the mix and life becomes different, better, even more joyful. What’s not to like? </strong>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Running Injuries: Accident or Human Error?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Running Injuries: Accident or Human Error?</h1>
<em><strong>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em>

<img class="size-full wp-image-7536 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Word-Art.png" alt="" width="1041" height="480" />

In 2014 there was a push in the media, and a new requirement in many state laws, that car accidents should no longer be called accidents, but to more accurately be called a crash or collision. The idea was to get people to realize that human error is the main cause of accidents.

According to the New York Times, “Almost all crashes stem from driver behavior, like drinking, distracted driving and other risky activities. About six percent are caused by vehicle malfunctions, weather, and other factors.”

We don’t have exact statistics for running injuries, but we do know that running is a high injury sport and many of those injuries could be avoided with good running technique and appropriate training.

Generally, we put running injuries into two main categories: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/injuries/">Impact and overuse injuries</a>. <strong>For now, let’s look at three areas to explore the nature of running injuries:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Running injury from an accident
</strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-7542" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/116706005_s.jpg" alt="Young woman with hit knee lying on the ground while active man leaning over her for help" width="519" height="346" /></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Running injury from a lack of knowledge or experience</strong>
<img class="wp-image-7544 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/121048221_s.jpg" alt="Sport man having doubts in a park" width="520" height="232" /></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Running injury from human error</strong>
<img class="wp-image-7545 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/28636098_m.jpg" alt="running injury - man jogging with knee pain. close-up view of runner injured jogging on the beach clutching his knee in pain. male fitness athlete." width="521" height="347" />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Running injury from an accident </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Life happens– unavoidable accidents are just a part of being human. Just like being in a car accident that is not your fault, there are times you get injured and there’s not a darn thing you can do about it, such as being hit by a bike, vehicle or another runner who has tripped and taken you down too. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Slipping on an unexpected patch of ice or mud could also fall into the accident category. Tripping, rolling your ankle on a curb, getting your shoelaces caught in a tree root on a trail can mostly be in the accident category. But in actuality, there are techniques and a level of conditioning that could mitigate the chances of even that happening. So yes, they are accidents, but in many cases could also fall into the human error category. </span>

<img class="alignright wp-image-7548" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/31166355_s.jpg" alt="runner falling and getting injured on trail while female runner runs behind him" width="564" height="376" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to think rolling my ankle and tripping were accidents, but I’ve learned that the ChiRunning technique is a strong deterrent to both. Strengthening your core, as you do in ChiRunning, and creating proper balance makes you less likely to roll your ankle because you are more agile and light on your feet. The Chi Focus of lifting your ankle makes you less likely to trip over roots, rocks or uneven terrain. All the technique focuses help you to become more aware of your body, the requirements of the terrain, and the needs of the moment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, accidents happen, but just like car crashes, there is a lot you can do to be a safe driver and a safe runner. </span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Quick tip for trail running:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fold the loops of your laces into the web of your laces and you’ll never get yanked by your shoelaces getting caught in a branch again. </span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Running injury from a lack of knowledge or experience</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching my daughter to drive was not an easy experience. Terrifying, actually. Today, (knock on wood) she’s truly a good, and safe driver, at least when I’m with her. I know she’s aware of the dangers and consequences of unsafe driving habits.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I taught her to never tailgate; always be aware of kids, animals, and other cars on the road; maintain a safe speed; and to put on a playlist of music </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking off, so she can focus on the road. I started pointing out unsafe drivers about a year before she got her driver’s permit in addition to difficult or dangerous places that needed special attention in our small but busy city. Of course, she also participated in Driver's Education, which is required in North Carolina like most other US states. </span>

<img class="alignright wp-image-3049" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/danny-dreyer-teaching-posture-the-chiwalking-technique.png" alt="" width="471" height="340" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to running, most people don’t get the kind of education and support they need. This led us to create the <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/">ChiRunning School</a> to educate runners on how to run safely and correctly! Similar to Driver's Ed, we think proper running education should also be required for new and experienced runners alike! We’ve got the idea that “just doing it” or “give it your best shot” is the best way to run. For a limited few it works, but usually, as those "natural athletes" age, they need <em>more</em> than their natural inclination to keep them going and injury-free. Learning some basic skills builds confidence and dramatically reduces our potential for injury, especially for beginners.</span>

<strong>Injuries from lack of education are, I think, the biggest of these 3 categories. Here are some conventional misconceptions about running: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t learn to run– just run as you did as a kid</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s supposed to be a strenuous workout for it to be valuable</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your legs need to get stronger for you to get faster</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed matters</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you walk-run it should be in specific intervals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be able to run a 5K in 8 weeks, a 10K in 12 weeks, a half marathon in 16 weeks and a marathon in 20 weeks. Some plans are more aggressive than that, even for absolute beginners. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have pain, knee or otherwise, you’re not meant to run</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, the worst one of all: running is painful so just run through the pain (“No Pain, All Gain”)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each one of these beliefs can lead to a host of unnecessary injuries, from either impact or overusing muscles that should hardly be used in the first place. These beliefs can also keep you from enjoying this wonderful sport, thinking your running days are over at the first sign of pain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, with some simple adjustments, you could continue running for the rest of your life. Your body is built to run– no matter your age or body type. </span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Running injuries from human error and making mistakes</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This last category is what happens when people know better, but don’t listen to their body, their intuition, or the basis of knowledge they’ve cultivated. These injuries are the crashes and collisions of human error and run the gamut of running injuries: from knee pain to shin splints to plantar fasciitis and IT band syndrome. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing people say they’ve signed up for a half or full marathon but haven’t been training, I get the sense of an impending crash.</span>

<strong>Here are several mistakes I see people make causing injury (even when they know better): </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running too far or too fast for your level of technique and conditioning</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not listening to the early signs of pain</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to keep up with faster-paced runners </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a run too fast without warming up</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretching cold muscles</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overusing your lower legs, instead of using a gravity-assisted running technique</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor diet choices including dehydration, low electrolytes, not enough clean fuel</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor-fitting, worn-out or overbuilt shoes</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not adapting your technique to the terrain</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of our </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master Instructors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently said, “It’s crucial to get your mind’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of what you should be able to do, out of your running, and let your body’s needs rule your workouts.” </span>

<b>The bottom line:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Running is a high injury sport but you’re far less likely to injure yourself when you get the education and support you deserve while maintaining a mindful approach to your practice.  </span>

		<title><![CDATA[September 2019 Instructor of the Month: Aaron Lew]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-7573 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Aaron-Lew-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="339" />I am Lew Seng Leong (Aaron). I live in Singapore. I am a Certifying Master ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking Instructor, a Garmin Coach and a Life
Coach/Motivational Speaker. My athletic background is in multi-sports racing and coaching, now I am mainly coaching ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking. I have raced every distance from 5k to ultras, triathlons, IRONMAN to adventure racings.I am a full-time practicing Engineering Professional in addition to coaching CR.

<strong>How did you start running?
</strong>I started running to build up my aerobic fitness for competitive volley ball games when I was a teenager.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
I knew ChiRunning in the early 2000 when I raced competitively in triathlons and adventure racings through a Total Immersion (TI) swimming coach. Back then, running efficiently with good technique was never that important so to speak, for most of the competitive athletes around me.
I am fascinated by ChiRunning that stresses running with the pull of gravity with strong core muscles rather than depending on the leg muscles to run. I managed to get hold of ChiRunning DVDs, audios and books, then the rest is history…

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?
</strong>The idea of running simply by moving the Dantien forward in great posture is amazing! Knowing the deep potentials and practical use of our core muscles such as the active/passive pelvic rotation to run faster has been an eye-opening experience for me too.

In addition, chi also maximize the use of our bone structure (the strongest components in our body) when carry out a weight bearing exercises like running. The midfoot striking pattern and the vertical and directional alignment of chi is so fundamentally right with human body in the sport of long distance running. With an understandings of the ChiRunning principles, I find a true pleasure in every steps that I run!

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>ChiRunning may be is only for the older generation/seniors or the injured runners.

<strong>What motivates you to run?
</strong>I run because it gives me a sense of FREEDOM and helps me to stay fit.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
I am proud to change the life of a senior (in his 60s) who never run, from walking with hip pain to running on track in 8 weeks.

I am also proud to coach a runner in his 20s, from failing IPPT (for a few times) to clinching a GOLD AWARD in his IPPT (Individual Physical Proficiency Test) as part of his National Service obligation in Singapore.

<strong>What led you to become an Instructor?</strong>
I like to share the joy of ChiRunning and help all liked minded people to sustain and achieve their goals with good running and walking technique.

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I enjoy being connected to people as an instructor. I learn to speak, organize and having the confidence to coach people with different backgrounds. Coaching has broadened up my horizon.

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
I run typically 25-30km a week. Most runs are after office hours, running home with my camelbak. I am doing once a week 20-30 minutes barefoot run on a green field with gentle hills on it.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
I am doing functional training and core exercises regularly.

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong>
ChiRunning is a life long learning process. New ChiRunner needs to learn to relax and give themselves time to build up good habit.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race and why:</strong> Standard Chartered Marathon. It is a well organized race that is held every year around December. This is the last race of a season, I get to run together with a few close buds, pacing each other, afterwards I can relax a little before the next season begins!

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> Mountain running and adventure racings in China with top class athletes all around the world in the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest in 1999 and 2001.

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> Cool 18-20 degree celcius, running in the mountain.

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Lift the Crown of Head, Move The Dantien

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> Barefoot runs on a big green field with some small hills.

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Coffee and bread

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> Fish porridge with milk tea

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> I like to help more people to find the joy of running with ChiRunning

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Occasionally running with music

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> iTunes Songs of the Summer (mixture of pop, dance and R&amp;B hits)

<strong>If I didn’t run</strong> I hang around with my kids.

<strong>I can’t run without thinking about</strong> Lifting the Crown of Head and Lead The Move With Dantien.

<strong>My first race was </strong>a 10km cross country run in the neighborhood of where I grew up and I started to realize I can do long distance running!

<strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is </strong>New Balance Zero Drop with Vibram sole.

<strong>My most difficult run ever was </strong>42km Ironman run.

<strong>I’ve</strong> lost count or <strong>how many marathons/races I've run.</strong>

<strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> is a 50km ultra trail running challenge at the North Face Trail Running Challenge 2012, Singapore]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Solution to Stretching Before Running]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should You Stretch Before Running? </span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to address the age-old question: Should you stretch before you run? Does it help performance? Does it help prevent injury? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While no one enjoys running with stiff muscles, static stretching before running isn’t the answer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Static stretching before you run actually makes it more likely that you’ll injure yourself by causing damaged tissue or strained/pulled muscles. In addition to this, studies have shown static stretching also has a negative effect on performance. </span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solution to Stretching Before You Run</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try ChiRunning Body Looseners, which loosen your joints instead of stretching your muscles. These are actually derived from T’ai Chi warm-up exercises, but work wonders on the fluidity of your stride. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Body Looseners will warm up your muscles while making your joints open and loose, causing your chi to flow through your body unhindered. With loose joints, you won’t need to work nearly as hard! </span>

<strong>Body Looseners are intended to loosen the main joint systems of the body: </strong>
<ul>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>How?</b></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Stand in your best posture</li>
 	<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting your body on one leg, bend one knee to put your toes on the ground just behind you. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move your bent knee in a clockwise circle while relaxing the ankle. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow your knee to do the movement so your ankle can relax and loosen. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do ten clockwise circles and ten counter-clockwise circles. Repeat with your other leg.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Why?</b></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exercise loosens all the ligaments and tendons around your ankles. </span></b></p>

<h4><strong>2. Knee Circles</strong></h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"></h5>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7617" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/knee-circles-body-loosners.gif" alt="" width="604" height="621" />
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How?</strong></h5>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place your feet and legs together with your hands on your knees. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move both knees around in clockwise circles. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let your knees extend in front of your toes. Keep your upper body as still as possible. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do ten circles in each direction. </span></li>
</ul>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exercise loosens all the ligaments and tendons around your knees.  </span></p>

<h4><strong>3. Spinal Twist</strong></h4>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7612" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/spinal-twist.gif" alt="" width="610" height="542" />
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How?</strong></h5>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in your best posture, put your hands behind your head and intertwine your fingers. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without moving your pelvis, turn your upper body to the right and dip your right elbow to the ground as you lift your left elbow to the sky. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twist a bit more and look for the backs of your heels. Hold for a few seconds.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return up from the dip and then back to the center, then repeat to the opposite side. Repeat 3 times. </span></li>
</ul>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exercise loosens the tendons in your upper spine and shoulders, allowing you a relaxed arm swing. </span></p>

<h4><strong>4. Pelvic Rotations</strong></h4>
<img class="wp-image-7610 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-body-loosener.gif" alt="" width="608" height="487" />
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How?</strong></h5>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand in a staggered posture stance with your right foot on  the ground behind you. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bend your elbows  and pretend your forearms are resting on the arms of a chair. This keeps  your shoulders and upper body from rotating. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do ten pelvic rotations by turning your waist with your dantien, and then switch your staggered stance so that your left leg is behind you. (Feel  your shoulders stable as your waist turns back and forth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also do this loosener facing a wall with your hands against the wall to keep your shoulders still.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ul>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This exercise loosens your spine at T12/L1. This will help prevent back pain/injury by keeping your spine loose and capable of proper posture and alignment. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To view all our Body Looseners, check out <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product/chirunning-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ChiRunning</em></a> (pp. 196-208). Or, <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiRunning School</a>, Lessons 77, 82, and 86.</strong> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin every run, make sure to start off very slowly, focusing on your technique and warming up your muscles. Then gradually let relaxation and flow be the source of increased speed until you’re at your regular pace. By this time your joints and muscles are both loose and warm, and ready for your run. </span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Should You Stretch? </span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don't stretch before you run, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stretch at all. The best time to stretch is right after your run when your muscles are warm. Stretching after running keeps your muscles from tightening or cramping.  It helps you recover faster and also preps your body for your next run or workout. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, do the stretches Danny recommends, go to an occasional yoga class, or <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/7-yoga-poses-for-chirunners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the yoga poses we recommend</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretching at the right time can have a big impact on your running– So remember, never before a run, regularly after a run, and do your Body Looseners before running. </span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Counteract the Negative Effects of Sitting</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Talk with Esther Gokhale &amp; Danny Dreyer</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>See the video and offer from Gokhale Method below.</em></p>
<p class="bard-text-block style-scope">I met Esther Gokhale in 2018 when I was teaching at the Kripalu Yoga Center. When I learned what the Gokhale Method was all about, I realized there is a deep connection between what she is teaching her students and what we teach in ChiWalking and ChiRunning.</p>
<p class="bard-text-block style-scope">We decided to do a video together talking about one aspect of posture in daily life that affects us all: <b class="bard-text-block style-scope">sitting. </b>In our talk, we show how sitting is responsible for many of the ills that show up in our bodies as we age.</p>
We also both firmly believe that these can be prevented and reversed when we pay attention to our posture– when sitting as well as when we’re moving around in our daily lives. The importance of posture cannot be overstated because the quality of almost every action we do is dependent on a combination of the proper alignment and balanced movement of our body.
<h5>A Little About the Gokhale Method</h5>
<img class=" wp-image-7666 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/gokhale-method-esther-gokhale-adjusting-womans-posture.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="347" />The Gokhale Method is an ecosystem of posture and movement re-education which uses healthy posture and movement to help you restore your structural integrity and regain a pain-free life. Created by founder and CEO Esther Gokhale (GO-clay), the Gokhale Method draws upon the ancient body-wisdom passed down through non-industrialized cultures to repattern the way we sit, stand, walk, lift, bend, and sleep. Their goal is a world without back pain. Most students find relief following the first lesson — and without time-consuming exercises or special equipment. Esther’s book 8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back has sold over 150,000 copies worldwide and has been translated into 10 languages. Qualified Gokhale Method teachers offer instruction around the globe.

		<title><![CDATA[Adding Speed with Ease: Active Pelvic Rotation]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Adding Speed with Ease: Active Pelvic Rotation</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d like to let you in on our secret: How to add power to your ChiRunning without increasing the workload to your legs. Sound crazy? Or, impossible? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal at ChiRunning is to convince you to run as relaxed as possible, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to go faster. Our whole intent is to show you how to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fall forward, into the pull of gravity, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for your propulsion while at the same time </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relaxing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your lower body, allowing the oncoming road to swing your legs for you. The sole purpose of doing these two things in your ChiRunning (falling and relaxing) is to redirect most of the workload away from your legs so that adding speed or distance to your running doesn’t cost you by increasing impact to your joints or overuse to your muscles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the guiding principles of ChiRunning is mindfulness-based movement, where you’re constantly working to improve your ability to sense your body, engage your mind and progress in your skill level. With that in mind, Active Pelvic Rotation is a more advanced skill to gain easy speed as the next step in your ChiRunning. It happens when you exert and direct some of the Chi you’ve been cultivating. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday, I did a long trail run that is about 1000′ of climb and shaved off about 20 minutes!  Pelvic rotation on the uphills with improved arm swing made all the difference! I was flying in 3rd gear on the downhills with such ease that I was just laughing with joy!  And, no soreness or knee pain today.” <strong>– </strong></span></em><strong>Cheryl, Reno, NV</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Falling forward is easier than pushing or pulling yourself forward. But allowing your legs to relax as you run can, for some, be a bit more challenging. That’s why we teach Passive Pelvic Rotation in all of our classes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelvic rotation has two modes: Passive Pelvic Rotation and Active Pelvic Rotation.</span>
<h4><b>Here’s what they are and how they differ:</b></h4>
<h5><b>Passive Pelvic Rotation</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In ChiRunning, you allow yourself to gently fall forward which allows gravity to pull you. Consequently, you are left with only having to pick up your feet to keep up with your forward motion. This significantly reduces the work done by your legs because, as you fall forward, you allow your lower body to relax, allowing your legs to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be swung rearward </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by the oncoming road. When your legs swing rearward as they hit the ground, impact to your knees, hips and lower back can become a thing of the past.</span>

<strong>The following illustration shows how conventional running (top) compares to ChiRunning (bottom). </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-7673 alignnone aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-2.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="419" /></span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Conventional Running</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">      <img class="wp-image-7676 alignnone" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-1.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="495" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>ChiRunning Pelvic Rotation</b></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With conventional running your pelvis always faces forward and your legs swing from your hips. With ChiRunning, as you fall forward, your legs and pelvis swing together and your stride length increases in the rearward direction because, as your leg swings rearward, it pulls your hip with it, creating a rotation in your pelvis. This gives you a longer rearward stride without adding stress to the hip joint. And, as you might have guessed, a longer </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rearward</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stride (as the Kenyans have so beautifully demonstrated) equals faster speed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">                </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is in stark contrast to conventional running which requires you to push yourself forward with every stride, which leads to chronic overstriding and is much less economical, especially if you’re running distances beyond a 5K. The muscle effort required to push you forward is what makes the typical runner more tired than they really need to be. It is much easier to pick up your feet than to push yourself forward when running.</span>

<img class="wp-image-7683 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-revised.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="466" />
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“It was my best race so far.  I felt strong, and there were many times when everything just came together – pelvic rotation, legs swinging to the rear, relaxed feet and legs, circular feet... I would feel like I was flowing over the ground practically without effort! I had a strong finishing kick at the end, and my overall per-mile pace was over 30 seconds faster than the Flat Half on Sauvie Island that I did in July. I felt pumped and energetic afterward, and had no soreness, and still none today!”</em>  – <strong>Mary, Portland, OR</strong></span></p>
<b>Benefits of Passive Pelvic Rotation:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adds smoothness to your stride (think Kenyans) by preventing over-striding (braking)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces impact, especially on downhills by emphasizing a rearward stride</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creates a more unified system of body movement by coordinating your upper body with your lower body</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protects your hamstrings from overuse by eliminating over-striding and “pulling”</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to learn, and it’s a total game-changer when you change your mindset from power to relaxation</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Active Pelvic Rotation</b></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-7681 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/active-pelvic-rotationss.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="233" />This is an advanced version of Passive Pelvic Rotation that can be used for running faster or for running up hills. I call it “advanced” because, in order to do it, you must first have integrated Passive Pelvic Rotation into your repertoire of ChiRunning skills. In other words, once Passive Pelvic Rotation has become your norm, you can then add in some power from your core without upping the workload to your legs.</span><b> </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Active Pelvic Rotation, you’ll gain “easy speed” by engaging your arms and your obliques, driven by your breath, which ups your amperage without blowing a fuse. An exaggerated arm swing, with an emphasis both forward and rearward, drives your hips rearward by engaging your obliques, which in turn drives your legs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With ChiRunning, natural degradation of how you move as you age can be averted to a safe, sustainable, and intentional way of going faster or farther without taking it out on your body. Engaging your stronger core muscles (in this case primarily obliques) to drive your hips and legs, keeps the smaller, more vulnerable muscles of your legs from overworking.</span>

<b>Benefits of Active Pelvic Rotation:</b>

<img class="wp-image-7686 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/i-5MM4HXz-X2.jpg" alt="Instructor demonstrating Chirunning technique pelvic rotation" width="396" height="526" />
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfers your power source </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">away</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your legs by engaging your obliques and arm swing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases efficiency by using a larger, stronger group of muscles to replace a smaller muscle group… with the same, or better, results</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows you to rely on two muscle groups (arms and obliques) few distance runners ever use</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adds power to your stride without relying on the strength of your legs</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re a new, or slower runner, or love to run fast, the source and impetus for your movement come from the same place when you practice ChiRunning– your pelvis. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about Passive and Active Pelvic Rotation, </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/find-an-instructor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">find a Certified ChiRunning instructor near you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or check out the </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning School videos and lessons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see how it’s done.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so used to using strength, force, and exertion in our lives, and especially in our fitness programs, we’ve lost sight of our innate ability to move, and especially to run, easily in a relaxed but powerful way. </span>

		<title><![CDATA[Chi Shoe Review: Carets Dress Shoes]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Chi Shoe Review: Carets Dress Shoes</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This review is for the </span><a href="https://carets.com/collections/main-store/products/fer-cap-toe-oxford-honey-brown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carets FER 4.1 Cap-Toe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, produced and sold by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.carets.com/">Carets.com</a></span></em></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7769" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-1.13.21-PM.png" alt="" width="668" height="492" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was asked to review a pair of Carets dress shoes, I was excited to put all of my transferable knowledge of designing and reviewing running shoes to the test on a shoe that has little to do with running… except maybe running to catch the last train out of the City.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s rare when I put on a new pair of dress shoes and they feel more like bedroom slippers than some sort of a jail cell for my feet. From the minute I put on my Carets, they were like putting on my favorite running shoes… the ones I could run a marathon in, without any soreness, blisters or hot spots.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a running coach, I always recommend shoes that are zero-drop or close to it. With dress shoes that rule is even more important, whether I’m standing in line at airports, catching a subway, or doing anything that involves lots of standing, these shoes, with their low profile and comfortable fit, met all my needs from the first step… and I’m ridiculously picky about my shoes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Carets boasts a zero-drop, I was immediately interested in how they felt, and they didn’t disappoint. For a full-grain leather dress shoe, there was almost no break-in period. That’s pretty radical for a dress shoe. The toe box was wide enough to fit my 4E foot with no tightness </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slippage. I don’t know how they did it, but they designed the shoe with a tapered, yet wide forefoot, so on the outside it doesn’t look I have the genetics of a Hobbit, even if I do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The finish work is the highest quality and they’re elegant and stylish without being showy. I love these shoes enough to start looking for reasons for this die-hard runner to dress up.</span>

<strong>Here are some of the noteworthy points of Carets' dress shoe:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable Polyurethane Soles</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexible</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Grain Leather</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Heel</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intricate Detailing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightweight</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-Slip</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-Drop Design</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you Carets, for building an awesome shoe. I’m sold!</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Chi for Maximum Brain Health]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Chi for Maximum Brain Health</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/katherine/">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our last visit to AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), where we have taught running and walking to the staff for years, we met with their new group whose focus is on Brain Health. </span>

<img class=" wp-image-7421 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/brain.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="231" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brain health is the new heart health,” we were told. “And what we’ve learned is that the best way to improve your brain’s health and functioning is for you to teach your body something new.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy heart is, of course, crucial, but your brain’s health is in charge of all of your body’s systems. A decline in your cognition can mean a decline in many aspects of your health. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to improve your cognitive function. <strong>AARP has 5 Pillars of Brain Health: Move, Discover, Relax, Nourish, Connect.</strong> From their research with the leading organizations on brain health, they have come to know that exercise is at the top of the list. And even more effective is using your brain while you’re moving, and teaching your body new ways to move. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7794" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/depiction-of-the-5-pillars-of-brain-health-AARP.png" alt="" width="900" height="300" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sudoku. Crossword puzzles. Computer training. Half of Americans believe these games and mental tasks keep their brains healthy, according to a 2014 AARP survey — but there is little evidence that they do. If you really want to retain mental clarity and improve your odds of staving off dementia, researchers say, hit the gym.” </span></i></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your mind is paying attention to your body, teaching it something new, paying attention to what the body is doing, and moving at the same time, the brain’s cognitive functioning gets the best workout and the best results. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning and ChiWalking offer you the perfect opportunity to improve your brain’s functioning while also improving cardiovascular health, emotional balance, building bone mass and learning techniques to protect your body for the rest of your life. The mindfulness component of the Chi techniques can be like a meditation for the brain, curtailing your mind’s proclivity to jump from one subject to another. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing your mind on your body, on your breath, and on learning something new, quiets the mind and gives you access to the unexpressed messages from the body. As you get good at Body Sensing, you tap into a deeper wisdom that is housed, not in your mind, but in your body. You’ll become more aware of what your body needs and be able to respond more appropriately. We call this the Upward Spiral of Chi. <img class=" wp-image-2856 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/elderly-couple-walking-chiwalking-activeaging.png" alt="" width="490" height="353" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York Times, in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/well/move/how-exercise-affects-our-memory.html?fallback=0&amp;recId=1KmXXRihwqUpKMYoz7Hiiimu53n&amp;locked=0&amp;geoContinent=NA&amp;geoRegion=NC&amp;recAlloc=home&amp;geoCountry=US&amp;blockId=home-living-vi&amp;imp_id=107397872&amp;action=click&amp;module=Smarter%20Living&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Exercise Affects our Memory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  “Even a single workout may make our brain’s memory centers, like our muscles, more fit.” However, learning something new and repeating new patterns of movement helps build new neurotransmitters in your brain, making connections that were not there before. The new science of neuroplasticity tells us that we are very capable of rewiring our brains, but it takes focus and attention. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Huff Post article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewiring Your Brain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Each time your brain strengthens a connection to advance your mastery of a skill, it also weakens other connections of neurons that weren't used at that precise moment. This negative plastic brain change erases some of the irrelevant or interfering activity in the brain.” In other words, by repetitive practice, your brain can be rewired to do and experience an activity, such as running or walking in a new way, and in doing so delete old ways of thinking and behaving. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-1077 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/running_brain.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="221" />Additionally, when you have repeated positive experiences, such as feeling good after a run or walk, you are rewiring your brain to associate running and walking with that positive experience. When your efforts to learn healthy skills for running and walking pay off with less pain and more joy, your body is even more likely to repeat those same patterns. This helps you stick to your exercise regime and learn new, positive ways of experiencing and being. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, new studies about the brain in your gut only adds to the benefits of ChiRunning and ChiWalking. The focus on your dantien in your lower abdomen gives you even greater access to the brain in your gut which is home to your creativity, intuition and a greater sense of the whole of any experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As science catches up with what the great T’ai Chi and meditation Masters have known and passed down for thousands of years, the confirmation of the benefits of ChiRunning and ChiWalking keeps expanding and deepening. </span>

<strong>To improve your brain’s health, focus your mind, strengthen your core and keep your neurotransmitters firing and connecting. Learn, explore, discover, connect and KEEP MOVING!! </strong>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Running After 50]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Running After 50</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Responding Well to Life's Inevitable Changes</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re reading this, you’re aging. Like it or not, none of us can pass on that hand. And, as long as you HAVE to age, do whatever you can, to do it well. The main theme driving a lot of “graceful aging” programs involves </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">choosing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a good quality of life for as long as you can.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my early forties, I started running ultras. My crazy thirties were behind me and my mind felt settled enough to allow me to run with more calm and clarity for longer periods of time. My body and mind seemed to strike a deal where both enjoyed the challenge of those longer endurance events.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, turning forty-five, subtle changes in my body began popping up. My metabolism slowed down to where I could no longer eat my usual amount of food without gaining weight. I was no longer running any “Personal Bests.” I had to train harder just to maintain my fitness status quo. And, for the first time in my adult life, I felt like taking a nap. Does any of this sound familiar?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our late forties, our bodies begin making more noticeable changes: </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/womens-bodies-womens-running/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women‘s bodies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">begin producing less estrogen and losing more bone mass. Thus the recommendation for regular weight-bearing activities. Men </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women produce less testosterone, which reduces your body’s ability to maintain muscle mass. The advice of physiotherapists is to adopt a resistance/strength training regimen. And, as your ability to move diminishes, the body requires some form of active stretching (yoga, Pilates, T’ai chi, etc.) to maintain a good range of motion as you age. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In your fifties, all of those things that might have been only nuances before, are now facts of life. This is compounded, unfortunately, by a plethora of new things to be aware of, and deal with. Whether you attribute it to accumulated wisdom, a mid-life crisis or finally sensing your own mortality, many of us at fifty begin to feel the need to maintain or improve our quality of life. It also becomes even more apparent that if you want to maintain that good quality of life as you age, you must become</span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/mindful-fitness-a-guide-to-incorporating-mindfulness-into-your-daily-workou/"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more mindful</span></i> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the years add up. </span>

<strong>Here are some mental and physical suggestions for making your fifties a positive experience and an adventure in mindfulness:</strong>

<b>Physical Options:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Maintain muscle tone and bone density: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your body slows down and has less ability to produce muscle mass and bone density, accept it. It’s not the time to push. Use finesse (attention to technique) and channel the flow of Chi through breathwork, mental focus and relaxation to keep your mind healthy and your body moving well. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running and walking are both excellent (and convenient) ways to keep your muscles toned and your bones strong. Running 3-4 days per week is ideal. <img class="alignright wp-image-7894" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/44726999_m.jpg" alt="Active seniors running outside in green nature" width="377" height="250" /></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay particular attention to your technique while walking and running. Since your body is not as strong, you have to make up for your loss of strength by learning to walk and run more efficiently. This is, in part, what </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chiwalking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiWalking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed for.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your weekday workouts should be short and a mix of light speed intervals, easy hills and </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technique drills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (done more for muscle tone, technique and range of motion (ROM) than anything else). </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a week do a longer run, building up to whatever distance leaves you comfortably fatigued. This run should be done at a very comfortable training pace. A great way to do a long run is to mix in some </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/get-started/walk-to-run/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run/Walk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intervals. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiking is also a good way to cross-train for running. You can use trekking poles to add some upper-body strengthening while you’re at it.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start Weight Training: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already, start a light weight-training regimen with hand weights or on some sort of universal gym equipment. Have a personal trainer show you which exercises will assist you in your walking or running. Increase these workouts in the number of reps, and not necessarily in weight.<img class="alignright wp-image-7896" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/foto-garage-ag-PQGfC-J63VM-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="254" /></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Maintain Good Range of Motion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a good Pilates coach, T’ai Chi master, or AIS coach (</span><a href="https://www.stretchingusa.com/active-isolated-stretching/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Isolated Stretching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). All of these systems promote dynamic stretching where you stretch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthen your muscles while improving your range of motion! </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eat wisely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/the-art-of-eating-well/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adjust your diet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to meet the needs of an aging body. Be very intentional with your diet as your metabolism slows.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid processed foods that are low in Chi, but high in salt, sugar and saturated fats.</span></li>

<b>Mental Options:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know how the brain starts losing function as we age. Diseases like Alzheimers and dementia can in many cases be slowed or avoided by taking the right steps </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">early on</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in one’s life. The saying, “use it or lose it” holds especially true when we’re talking about the brain! Here are some things to do that can help:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Challenge Yourself:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mentally stimulating activities like math, puzzles, memory games or learning a new language or musical instrument, may help reverse cognitive decline.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Teach a class or take a class: <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great way to keep your brain active and be social at the same time.</span></b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Listen to Music: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2007/07/music-moves-brain-to-pay-attention-stanford-study-finds.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2007 showed that listening to music may sharpen the brain’s ability to anticipate events and stay focused.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be Social: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social interaction requires you to engage areas of the brain that are used in many cognitive tasks.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Get Moving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Of course, exercise is at the top of the list to help your aging body, but it’s just as important when it comes to keeping your mind sharp! </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is only a shortlist of ways to greet your fifties with open arms instead of fear and dread. The main emphasis of ChiWalking, ChiRunning, and ChiLiving is to help you create a higher quality of life, at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> age. Instating healthy habits will only improve your quality of life as your years add up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And the time to start, regardless of your age, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is NOW!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A Santé!</span>

		<title><![CDATA[November 2019 Instructor of the Month: Constanza Lisdero]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.<img class=" wp-image-7915 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Constanza_1-206x300.jpeg" alt="" width="309" height="450" /></h2>
My name is Constanza Lisdero and I live in Basel, Switzerland. In my “previous life”, I was a scientist with a PhD in Biology. I am a mother of 3 small kids, 2 cats, a dog, and a husband. I am a full-time mom, plus Running Coach and ChiRunning Instructor.

<strong>How did you start running?</strong>
I didn’t like running when I was a kid or a young adult. I was always active though, sailing, hiking, rock- climbing, biking. I understood running as a warm-up for whatever exercise I was doing in the gym, always in the treadmill and no more than 30min. More and I would fall apart. I thought humans were divided into runners and non-runners and I was the latter. I came to running from swimming, which also I could not do without feeling I was drowning… But there it was obvious to me that it was because I had never learned it properly… I took swimming lessons and became a competitive swimmer. Having learned how to swim made me wonder if I could also learn how to run. I googled “good running mechanics” and stumbled upon ChiRunning. Three days later I was attending my first workshop. I practiced, learned and it changed my life. Now I want to change other people's lives too.

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong>
I learned how to run, I learned that running is not about effort, I can run easy for the longest time. I never thought I could run more than 5k! And today I have done 2 marathons and several 1/2s.

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong>
We are all runners, whether experienced or beginners, we can all learn how to do it easier.

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>
Teaching people how to run without effort and helping them enjoy every run.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
Coaching women beginner runners to run their 1st. 1/2 marathon. One of my clients said that the ChiRunning based coaching program was the best thing that had happened to her in her life. I am proud of being able to inspire people to run the right way.

<strong>What led you to become an Instructor?
</strong>I want to help others run easy and pain-free. I want to improve people’s lives through movement, walking and running. I want to spread the good run.

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an Instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I am a full-time ChiRunning Instructor and Coach. It has given me endless possibilities to meet people where they are and help them reach their running goals. I love to inspire people to go beyond their dreams.

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
Group runs 4 times per week average of 6km each, Saturdays 2 Group Coaching
for Women training for their first races, average 25km.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
Walking, Swimming and biking.

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong>
Be patient, practice and enjoy. To learn something new you have to do it slowly.

<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race you’ve run and why: </strong>Basler Stadtlauf 5.5km. It is a night race in the center of Basel that opens the Xmas season. Running under the decorated city is amazing.

<strong>Most memorable race: </strong>My first full marathon, Berlin 2016. Wow…

<strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>Fresh and dry

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong>Training slow to run better and race fast.

<strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>The fields and forests around my house

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Dates

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> Whatever I can get fast.

<strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong>Another full Marathon in 2020 (Berlin?, Jungfrau?)

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Without phone or music. The metronome is my best friend

<strong>Repeat on your playlist: </strong>When with the phone….Shuffle through Danny´s ChiRunning School Lessons.

<strong>If I didn’t run I</strong> would walk.

<strong>I can’t run without</strong> peace of mind.

<strong>My first race was</strong> 5k in Lexington MA and I was happy as can be.

<strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is </strong>Altra Escalante.

<strong>My most difficult run ever was</strong> my first full marathon.

<strong>I’ve ran </strong>2 full, 4 1/2s, many 5ks, a few 10ks, marathons/races.

<strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> 42.195. Where? Berlin and Luzern]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[5 Ways ChiRunning is GOOD for Your Knees]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>5 Ways ChiRunning is GOOD for Your Knees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a ChiRunning Workshop in Orlando, FL a few years back, one of the attendees was the head trainer for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team. As you might guess he’s used to seeing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of bad knees (it comes with the territory). After the workshop, he came up and introduced himself, and one of the first things that came out of his mouth was, “I’m amazed… you have the knees of an 18-year-old!”</span>

<img class="alignright wp-image-7948 " src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ITB-Syndrome.jpg" alt="sports knee pain" width="328" height="328" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It made me feel pretty good because he had naturally assumed that I should have bad knees from all the running I had done. After all, at that point in my life, I was approaching the milestone of having run one hundred thousand miles in my 50 years of running and 65 years of living. I told him that having “young” knees wasn’t always the case with me. In my “pre-ChiRunning” days I had two nagging knee injuries that just wouldn’t go away: medial meniscus inflammation that came from</span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/how-to-prevent-knee-injury-and-knee-pain/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">splaying my feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and lateral knee pain in my IT Band from running with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bowed legs¹</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was okay as long as I didn’t run more than ten miles. But any longer distances would leave me a hobbling wretch for a couple of days afterward.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through my study of T’ai Chi, and during the development of </span><a href="http://www.chirunning.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I realized that if I changed how I aligned my body and changed some of my poor biomechanical habits, I could actually get rid of my knee pain permanently. It took me 3 ½ years to get rid of my foot splay (by strengthening my adductors) and correct my bowed legs (with ChiRunning Body Looseners). I can now report that I haven’t had any knee pain in over twenty-five years. That’s a LOT of pain-free miles! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times article, Running May be Good for your Knees² </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports on a recent study showing how running can help keep an optimum balance of fluids in your knees, ensuring just the right amount of cushioning and range of motion. They conclude:</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But even with these limitations, the findings suggest that moderate amounts of running are 'not likely to harm healthy knees and probably offer protection' against joint damage," Dr. Hyldahl suggests.</span></em></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vast majority of runners run 5Ks and 10Ks, many ChiRunners are happy successful marathoners and ultra-marathoners. This kind of distance, of course, is all predicated on running with a low-impact technique and “making friends” with the impact of the oncoming road, with healthy pelvic rotation and landing with a midfoot strike on a knee that is slightly bent. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another example</span>³<span style="font-weight: 400;">, five experts weigh in on how running can actually be good for your knees. The cautionary note that some of these docs give to those worried about damage to their knees is that if you are already experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis or osteoporosis, you should be very careful to make sure any pain you experience is not increasing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the same advice we give to runners. Body Sense what you’re doing and discern whether or not you’re moving in a way that is helping or harming your knees. If you’re constantly working on reducing your impact as you run, you’re on the right path. If you’re concerned about whether or not your technique is doing you harm I suggest learning the ChiRunning technique and also running on dirt paths whenever possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the correct shoes has a significant impact on keeping your knees happy as a runner. In recent years the popularity of minimal drop (4mm) or zero-drop shoes has been helping runners to avoid the increased impact created by shoes with too much heel thickness. When the heels of your shoes are too high, you actually hit the ground sooner and with more impact than if you have shoes with less of a heel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My case is only one of the countless cases of knee pain reversals created by ChiRunning. Since knee injuries perennially occupy the top of the all-time list of running injuries, I’d like to spread the word that running (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">correctly)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is actually good for your knees. </span><b>Here are five ways ChiRunning and </b><a href="http://www.chiwalking.com"><b>ChiWalking</b></a><b> will keep your knees healthy:</b>
<ol>
 	<li><b></b> <b>Lowers your impact
</b>Proper, low-impact running can keep your knees healthy well into your 70’s, and beyond. In ChiRunning and ChiWalking workshops we teach active people how to land more softly with every footfall. Many people overstride and strike the ground hard with their heels, which have no ability to absorb shock. ChiRunning and ChiWalking are both based on keeping your knees bent as they swing forward, which not only reduces shock to your knees as you land but allows your stride to open up <i>rearwards</i>, as it should. This reduces the amount of “deceleration” or braking that occurs when you over-stride.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7950" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Foot-strike-before_after.png" alt="" width="483" height="315" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b></b> <b>Keeps you moving
</b>Because ChiRunning and ChiWalking are designed around low-impact, both techniques keep your knees bending and moving, which keeps just the <i>right </i>amount of synovial fluid in your knees… not too much, which restricts your knee’s range of motion, or too little, leaving you with bone-on-bone. Ouch!
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7957" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/132274237_s.jpg" alt="Trail running man runner legs and shoes training on mountain outdoors. Nature landscape. Sport fitness male athlete" width="483" height="322" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b></b> <b>Strengthens your bones
</b>The consistent gentle impact of ChiRunning and ChiWalking helps to strengthen your bones and joints and can stave off osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. If you are genetically predisposed to osteoarthritis you might get it anyway. But, there have been many scientific studies showing that running itself does not cause arthritis. Quite the opposite… as long as you’re running without a lot of impact.

</ol>
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b></b> <b>Helps maintain a healthy BMI
</b>Being overweight is widely known to be hard on your knees. But having a consistent ChiRunning or ChiWalking practice can help you maintain a healthy BMI (Body Mass Index) as you age. Even if you’re just starting a weight-loss journey, you can still run light on your feet– it’s all in the technique!
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7953" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/9431942_s.jpg" alt="bare female feet standing on bathroom scale" width="483" height="408" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
 	<li><b></b> <b>Builds healthy movement habits
</b>Approaching your running or walking as a mindful practice (as ChiRunning and ChiWalking do) helps build good habits around exercise and movement, increasing your likelihood to continue moving gracefully as you age… with <i>less</i> likelihood of harming those precious knees along the way. Since the biggest culprit to bad knees is overstriding, we show runners and walkers how to reduce the length of their <i>forward</i> stride while increasing their stride as their legs swing rearward. This significantly reduces the amount of impact as your feet hit the ground. We are also huge proponents of NOT landing on your heels, where there is little to no shock absorption as you hit the road.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7432" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/active-older-couple-kneels-to-drink-water-and-talk-.jpg" alt="" width="483" height="322" /></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, it’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> running that hurts your knees, but the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you run that does the damage. Our goal is to help anyone who wants to have healthy knees, to be able to run for as long as they have the desire.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[ChiWalk-Run for Runners and Walkers]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Runners need me. Walkers do too.
Who am I?</h1>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8040" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chiwalkrun-fade.gif" alt="" width="600" height="145" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning helps you reduce impact, minimize overuse injuries, and makes running faster both easier and safer. But, it does not eliminate the need for walking. All runners can benefit from ChiWalking. In fact, all runners <em>need</em> ChiWalking to become better ChiRunners. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walkers also need to reduce impact and improve the way they move. Walking is so crucial to our movement patterns! The speed we walk is considered a 6th vital sign by the National Institute of Health:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Walking speed (WS) is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure appropriate for assessing and monitoring functional status and overall health in a wide range of populations. These capabilities have led to its designation as the <em>sixth vital sign</em>.”¹</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiWalk-Run offers a smooth transition between running and walking in addition to a set of skills that upgrade all aspects of your life. Although the foundations are fundamentally the same, ChiWalking and ChiRunning have some very important differences from which everyone can benefit.</span>
<h3>ChiWalk-Run for Walkers</h3>
<img class=" wp-image-8020 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20112390_s.jpg" alt="smiling woman exercising on running path in green summer park" width="369" height="553" />

<strong>As a ChiWalker, you do not need to add running to your workouts, but there are several reasons you should give it a try:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Adding just a little ChiRunning to your walks <strong>increases your cardio conditioning</strong> significantly.</li>
 	<li>If you're already a ChiWalker, your foundation for running is already in place:  good posture, forward upper body, arm swing, moving from your dantien, and lifting your feet, rather than pushing off. <strong>From ChiWalking, running at a slow pace is easy! </strong></li>
 	<li>Adding running to your workouts will help you<strong> burn more calories. </strong></li>
 	<li><strong>ChiRunning is easier than you think</strong> and may give you a new view of what you are capable of.</li>
 	<li>You never know when you might want or need to run. It's good to know you can!</li>
</ol>
<h3>ChiWalk-Run for Runners</h3>
<strong>For ChiRunners, learning and practicing ChiWalking may be more useful than you might think– not to mention, endlessly beneficial: </strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Easily start or return to running with ChiWalk-Run.</strong> Whether you're a beginner or coming back after a hiatus, building your cardio and muscular capacity with ChiWalk-Run is safe and gentle to the body while building your confidence.</li>
 	<li><strong>Give yourself the opportunity to practice your Chi Skills all the time:</strong> walking to the water cooler, grocery shopping, walking through the airport, etc. The more you practice in your every day walking, the better your running will feel.</li>
 	<li><strong>Transition with ease during an event.</strong> Most runners transition poorly, degrading their running form every time they stop and start up again. For example, if you're stopping for water or fuel during your run/event, the transition from walking to running is critical to ensure you keep the Chi flowing, maintain your alignment, and stay relaxed and light-footed. The ChiWalk-Run transition is seamless, mindful, and easy on your body.<img class=" wp-image-8027 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/group-running-track.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="221" /></li>
 	<li><strong>ChiWalk-Run any distance</strong>, from your first mile to a full marathon, allowing you to participate in any distance event you choose.</li>
 	<li><strong>Return from injury with ChiWalk-Run.</strong> If you're recovering from any kind of injury or illness, ChiWalk-Run will give you the foundational strength you need to recover smoothly, without relapse.</li>
 	<li><strong>Traverse easily through bad weather and terrain.</strong> Use ChiWalk-Run to give your body the break it needs when you're faced with challenging weather conditions (snow, ice, wind, etc) and terrain (rocky, steep, etc).</li>
 	<li><strong>Smoothly transition to new, lower profile shoes</strong> while maintaining your current distance by adding ChiWalking intervals to your run.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improve your technique with ChiWalking.</strong> We teach a lot of the basic technique while walking because it can be easier to learn some focuses at a slower pace like moving from your dantien, picking up your feet, swinging your arms. The speed that comes with running can mask many mistakes, so slowing down to ChiWalking can help you evaluate where your technique needs work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Challenge yourself with ChiWalking.</strong> Learning ChiWalking can be more difficult than learning ChiRunning; but if you really get the movements of ChiWalking down, you'll be a much better runner.<img class=" wp-image-8031 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/group-running-on-trail.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="486" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Enjoy the scenery with ChiWalk-Run.</strong> Not every workout needs to be fast and furious. Sometimes it's nice to slow down a bit: enjoy the scenery and smell the roses.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increase your mileage with ChiWalk-Run.</strong> Incorporating ChiWalk-Run can help you add mileage while preventing overuse injuries. Run 3 miles, then walk-run 2 more miles.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep running as you age with ChiWalk-Run.</strong> You don't ever have to give up running completely if you learn to give your body a break when it needs it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your running ego in check.</strong> Running seems a bit more exciting and worthy of awe than walking, but walking is the underused, underappreciated, unsung hero of fitness. <strong>ChiWalk-Run combines the best of both! </strong></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Refine both your ChiRunning and ChiWalking skills for a lifetime of mindful fitness no matter your circumstances. The more you practice the ChiRunning and ChiWalking skills, the more confidence you’ll build in your capacity to handle anything that comes your way. </span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The ChiLiving Guide to Cultivating & Balancing Your Energy]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">The ChiLiving Guide to Cultivating &amp; Balancing Your Energy</h1>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</em></h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-8111" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/holiday-stress.png" alt="" width="555" height="619" />Although the darkest time of the year, when the natural world shows us that it is time to rest, the holiday season seems to be primarily about doing, accomplishing, producing, and attending to the myriad of things that call for our attention. If you’re not hosting or attending a party, you may be going to your children’s school program, bedecking your home in holiday decorations, writing cards, buying gifts, or shopping and cooking special meals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t even include work, which also may have pressing, year-end deadlines. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has time to care for yourself with extra sleep, nourishing exercise and some much needed quiet time to listen to your heart’s desires for the New Year? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another underlying issue is not just the quantity of activities, but our perception that it all has to be perfect. TV shows and movies show a holiday season that has been staged with a lot of money and many hands to make it so, yet somehow we feel we have to live up to that staged set created by the media. It is an impossible standard to meet and can leave you feeling bad about yourself, despite all your well-intentioned efforts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In ChiRunning and ChiWalking we focus on conserving chi or energy.  It is a mindful practice to optimize your energy management. These same principles can be applied to everyday living. </span>

<b>Here are some suggestions that are not about changing </b><b><i>what</i></b><b> you’re doing, but </b><b><i>how</i></b><b> you approach all activities with your energy in mind: </b>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><b>1. Issue less energy
</b></b><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8115 " src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/90651161_s.jpg" alt="Two relaxed roommates in winter sitting on a sofa in the living room of a house interior" width="632" height="422" /></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In T’ai Chi one of the prime energy management concepts is called Gathering and Issuing. To issue less energy, you literally make less effort, regulating how much energy you exert and practice using only the amount necessary to accomplish the task at hand. That also means relaxing about the outcome. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start becoming more mindful of your energy one of the first things you might notice is that you expend a lot of energy when you really don’t need to. It’s all about conserving your energy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I teach posture in a ChiRunning and ChiWalking workshop I tell everyone to reduce their effort by 50% while maintaining the intention and the feeling of being aligned. And it really works. My students are able to maintain great posture while also relaxing. It’s one of the great ”aha!” moments in class. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to overexert when we have expectations that we should perform without flaw. Issuing less energy means accepting less than perfection and discovering the perfection in our supposed flaws. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relax and set aside your idea of the perfect holiday meal, gift, or party, and really focus on the true intention behind the holiday season, so that your energy is rightfully focused and expended instead of wasted and overextended.</span></span></p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><b>2. Gather more energy
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-8123" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/man-taking-moment-for-appreciation-and-gratitude-during-holiday-season-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="422" /></b></b></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems counterintuitive that we can gather energy while doing so much during the holiday season, but it is simply a mindset to cultivate. The key to gathering energy is to appreciate the moment. It is not the kind of appreciation you have to express, but a quiet, inward recognition of the value of what is all around you. Appreciation connects you with the people, animals and things in your life and that connection is like food for your body, mind, and soul, a true, deep source of nourishment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good place to start is appreciating yourself, taking stock of all that you do accomplish. Take time to give yourself a quiet compliment (no one has to know). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also gather the energy of nature around you with the Window Exercise. When outside imagine your chest is an open window and allow all the energy of the sky, the trees, and all of nature into that window. Allow that energy to flow down into your dantien which is below your navel and in towards your spine. It is the deep, quiet center of your body and your being and the best place to store energy for when it is needed.</span></b></b></p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>3. Keep your energy flowing</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-8125" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/33526679_s.jpg" alt="Multi Generation Family On Countryside Walk" width="632" height="421" />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chinese medicine, stagnant, blocked energy is the source of pain and discomfort. Most of the time we’re not aware of how much energy is frozen in our neck and shoulders. The main culprit is planning, analyzing, and overthinking. The activity literally draws your energy up to your head where it gets stuck in the muck of over-stimulation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is to turn to the “brain” in your gut more frequently. Drop your focus into your belly and feel for your gut response. The brain in your gut is more holistic, creative, and intuitive, which yields more balanced and comprehensive solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on the brain in your gut your energy flows into your body and into your dantien, a place where energy is meant to be stored and from where it can easily be sourced. It’s no wonder that your gut and your dantien are in the same place! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also keep your chi flowing with bite-sized but regular body movements. Stretch, take a walk, shake out your whole body whenever you can. Keep your energy flowing, open and fluid!</span></span></p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>4. Prevent energy leaks</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-8127 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/48002327_s-300x240.jpg" alt="Couple relaxing at home. Feet in Christmas socks near fireplace. Winter holiday concept" width="634" height="506" />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">While energy leaks are always present, they become especially prominent during the holiday season. Some causes of energy leaks may include over-dramatization, worry, high-stress family situations, poor planning, self-criticism, poor diet choices, overconsumption of holiday treats, and too much “yes”. These will all consume large amounts of your available energy, which you need now more than any other time of the year.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">It’s important to be constantly aware of lessening or preventing these energy leaks. Mindfully plan your holiday events with strong consideration for your overall health. Practice saying “no” when you have too much on your plate, figuratively and literally! And when you sense any of these happening in you, just step back and take a deep breath to reset.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you develop your energy management skills, you’ll see that there is much you can accomplish while still maintaining your center. Learning to manage the in-and-out flow of chi, your life force, you realize its value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This mindful practice gives back more than it takes and builds a reserve of energy so you can enjoy the holidays and your life to the fullest.  </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">The ChiRunner’s Diet: Eating for Endurance and Recovery</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Article contributed by Katie Dawson</strong></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-8229 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/landscape-78058_1920.jpg" alt="man running across landscape" width="712" height="473" /></span></p>
<em>Run, Forrest, run!</em>

This famous line from Forrest Gump (1994) is often quoted. In the movie, the titular character runs cross country for three years. The act of running in the movie is supposed to symbolize overcoming obstacles and becoming triumphant. While few people may be willing to embark on the same long-haul journey, many have taken to running with the same sort of enthusiasm Forrest had.

Running is said to have many proven benefits. <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/this-is-your-brain-on-running/">Here on ChiRunning we believe that your brain benefits</a> as much from running as your body does. “Runner’s high” sensation is often the reason people do it. It causes feelings of euphoria and elation, reducing anxiety and stress. However, many new runners forget that getting the most out of your run actually relies on taking care of yourself, and this includes your diet. Depending on your fitness goals, some kinds of food may be better for you than others. This is called periodized nutrition, which emphasizes that your daily fuel intake matches your volume of training. It takes some trial and error to learn what is suitable for your body and what feels right. In fact, <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/running-nutrition-typical-training-plan">meal plans by BBC Good Food suggest that a proper diet is what complements your training routine</a> as it will fuel you, make you fitter, and possibly reduce your body fat.
<h2>On light days<img class=" wp-image-8237 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mark-deyoung-mjcJ0FFgdWI-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="protein rich meal with chicken and vegetables" width="594" height="397" /></h2>
When you’re planning on taking it easy, your body requires fewer carbohydrates which can be consumed with only one meal. Opt for protein-rich foods for both meals and snacks as this will keep you satisfied and support muscle tissue growth and repair. Fat is your source of fuel on light days. Polyunsaturated fats like Omega-3 reduce inflammation on days of recovery, and an increased vegetable intake means consuming antioxidants that also help with muscle soreness. Throw in some fruits and grains, and don’t be afraid to experiment with flavor profiles and spices.
<h2>On moderate days</h2>
On moderate days, your carbohydrate and protein intake should also be moderate. Try starting with one serving of carbohydrates on two meals to fuel your body for training and also to keep it stored for your next run. Low-GI carbohydrates are ideal for a sustained release in energy. The meal that is not high in carbohydrates should be higher in protein, fats, and vegetables. Consider iron-rich foods as they deliver oxygen to working muscles and contribute to energy production during endurance training.
<h2>On heavy or high-intensity days</h2>
<h2><img class="wp-image-8234 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/food-2722674_1920.jpg" alt="sweet potatoes" width="598" height="398" /></h2>
Hydration is everything on heavy training days as you produce more sweat. It is advised to include carbohydrates in all meals to increase muscle glycogen or fuel levels. Snacks that are higher in GI carbohydrates can be consumed to up your carbohydrate intake which acts as your main fuel. Try to keep a balanced intake of protein and polyunsaturated fats as well for recovery, muscle growth, and adaptation. Stay away from high fiber and spicy foods as these may cause gastrointestinal issues that will interrupt your run.
<h2>During an actual run</h2>
If the run is less than 45 minutes, water should suffice. But for longer distances and even marathons, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/healthy-eating-for-runners">the New York Times' ‘How to Feed a Runner’ advises carrying some carbohydrates</a> and fuels which can be found in sports drinks, gels, and energy chews. Bananas also make a good source of natural fuel and potassium. You can even eat and drink something every four miles of your run, when there is an incline, or when you are tired. Try to use the same brands of sports drinks and gels that you’ve already tried if you intend to bring them on a marathon.
<h2>Post-run</h2>
Always remember to watch what you eat after you run long distances. Because insulin levels are high and are delivering glycogen to muscle cells, it’s advised to eat carbohydrates immediately after or within two hours of a long run to help restore burned glycogen. Protein also helps in muscle recovery. Try having chocolate milk, peanut butter, bananas, full-fat yogurt, or fruit.
<h2>Clarifying assumptions</h2>
One of the biggest obstacles to creating a good food plan for yourself is challenging preconceived notions about food, as some of the food you once thought was bad for you may actually be good. <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/5-healthy-fats-your-diet-is-missing/">We previously discussed in our post on the ‘5 Healthy Fats Your Diet is Missing’</a>, that some fats are actually essential to your overall wellbeing. Unsaturated fats are healthiest as they hold more nutritional value and lower your cholesterol unlike trans and unsaturated fats. Healthy fats do not necessarily equate to weight gain, but can actually curb cravings and appetite and keep you appeased faster and longer. They are essential for hormone production, cell generation, muscle movement, and blood clotting, among others. Chances are, you have some of them at home already.

Consider avocados which are some of the most nutritious fruits out there. Olive oil is high in monosaturated fats which improve memory, cognitive function, and are anti-inflammatory. Or perhaps, switch out olive oil for coconut oil which boosts fat burning, brain function, memory, and heart health. Nuts, seeds, and cacao nibs are perfect snacks that are chockfull of nutrients. <a href="https://online.maryville.edu/online-doctorate-degrees/doctor-nursing-practice/">Maryville University’s discussion on current healthcare trends</a> shows that doctors and nurses continually challenge assumptions about things we thought to be established facts, so nothing is really set in stone: there’s no reason to stop trying new things and to stop learning. Learn what works for your body and reap the rewards later.
<h2>Best foot forward</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-8239 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/robert-calderon-Tb9_RyHifaA-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="three men running on sidewalk" width="713" height="531" />

Not everyone has the stamina and endurance as Forrest Gump. However, for those who even have a fraction of it, they need to constantly challenge some misconceptions. Runners struggle with the repetitiveness that running seems to be associated with, as well as the idea that healthy diets are supposedly bland. Every runner or potential runner has these struggles, but the important thing is to keep putting your best foot forward. Through ChiRunning, you might find exactly what you need to keep going.

This is the beginning of a long and daily journey back to running for me but <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/running-freely-like-a-7-year-old-again-with-chirunning/">ChiRunning has made it possible and pain-free</a>. Do yourself a favor and spend some time with this genius communicator. You never know, he may even change your life.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations to our newest Senior and Master Instructors!</h1>
Every year, our Instructors spend hundreds of hours teaching, studying, and deepening their knowledge of wellness. Our Instructors are so dedicated and enthusiastic about spreading ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking to everyone!

It's such a huge accomplishment to become a Certified Instructor with so much work put into it. It takes even more time, effort, and teaching to upgrade their status to a Senior or Master Instructor.

<strong>With pleasure, we'd like to congratulate our Instructors who have attained new levels this year!</strong>

		<title><![CDATA[What's more important than your legs?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Forget about your legs... It's all about your arm swing!</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember when I started my first running program as an adult. I wanted to get more fit and running seemed like the quickest and cheapest way to get there. Like most people, I thought I could just head out on a run and somehow my body would know what to do. But as I took off, I distinctly remember saying to myself, “I don’t know what to do with my arms!” They were swinging, but I was clueless about whether I was swinging them too much or too little; whether I was bending my elbows enough; how to hold my hands. It felt like I was having a disembodiment episode with my arms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after studying body movement for the past thirty years, I’ve come to the conclusion that our arms are actually much more important to our walking and running than our legs. Almost every movement in my lower body is either controlled, driven, enhanced, or balanced by the motion of my arms. Sounds crazy, but here are some of the things I’ve discovered.</span>

<img class=" wp-image-8312 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dannyarmswing.gif" alt="" width="864" height="486" />
<h2><b>As above… so below</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A NASA scientist once told me that any part of a machine that is not moving optimally puts a drag on the efficiency of the entire machine. It’s called inertia. Then, the good-working parts have to work harder (or less efficiently) as a result of this drag.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your arms are no different. When you hold tension in your shoulders, your arms don’t swing as easy and relaxed as they could. You subsequently burn more fuel, get tired more quickly, and tend to move more slowly because your legs have to work harder to make up for all that tension upstairs. So, if you learn to relax your shoulders and allow your arms to swing freely and easily, your legs won’t have to work as hard to hold the same speed.</span>
<h2><b>Balance of Power: For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you want to go faster, all of that drive comes from your arms and torso, which is used to drive your legs rearward. Look at the picture of sprinters at the starting line, and notice how muscular their arms are. That’s because of all the forward force that’s needed to drive their legs rearward with speed and power. Try to run fast without using your arms and you’ll quickly see what I’m talking about. </span>
<h3><b>More things your arms do</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They stabilize your body during movement. I notice especially when I’m running on trails, which requires lots of quick lateral adjustments. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They work to keep you balanced over your feet, whether you’re going uphill, downhill, or on uneven terrain.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For engaging the almost limitless power of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">obliques</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive the hips and legs (that’s another whole discussion) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good arm swing allows your stride to have a better range of motion with less vertical bounce.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They help you keep a steady and rhythmical connection with your breath and your feet. </span></li>
</ul>
<img class="wp-image-8318 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chander-r-AtfA8NDgpKA-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="452" />
<h2><b>Try these Arm Exercises</b></h2>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Exercise A</b></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><img class=" wp-image-8316 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/danny-running-tall-518x768-1.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="521" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next time you’re walking outdoors, make yourself aware of where your hands are. If you’re just out on a leisurely stroll they’re probably swinging at your sides where they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be. It’s relaxing! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if you want to walk faster, more in a mode of fitness walking, hold your hands a bit higher as you swing your arms. Don’t pump your arms, just bend them at the elbow by holding your hands at rib-height and notice the difference this small adjustment makes in your stride. You should feel your legs swinging much more easily and with a slightly faster step. Your impact with the ground will soften and your hips won’t feel as much of a jolt as your feet swing forward to hit the ground. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can feel the difference this makes in your walking, just think of how big of an impact it would have on your running. Try exaggerating the swing of your arms by swinging your elbows more rearward than usual. Balance this rearward arm swing with a slight forward fall and feel your legs swinging easily, landing in a softer footfall with a quicker, more efficient cadence. Instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“pounding the pavement” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll find yourself </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gliding</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the surface of the earth. </span></p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Exercise B</b></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another use for your arms is to sync your movement with your breathing. As you walk (or run) swing your arms to a rhythm that goes: 1-2…1-2-3...1-2…1-2-3 and so on. As you count out these numbers with every step you take, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exhale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 1-2 count, and inhale during the 1-2-3 count. Start by getting used to walking to this rhythm, sync your breath to your steps, by breathing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out through your lips</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2 counts and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in through your nose</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 3 counts. Once you feel comfortable using this rhythm, bring it into your running. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re just out for a casual stroll, there’s no need to sync your breath with your stride. But, as you move into fitness walking, or running, it makes quicker movement much easier.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No machine works as well as it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without the cooperation of all of its parts. Don’t make the mistake of thinking your arms are just along for the ride. Tap into the potential of your arms and they’ll quickly become your best ally.</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Running Your Best at 40+]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Running Your Best at 40+</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase, “Life begins at 40,” and without a doubt, some of the best years of my life were in my forties. But, all that good didn’t just happen. As I turned forty, I began to notice changes in my body that I should have expected, but didn’t.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if it’s just my imagination, but whenever I drive across a state line, I can sense that I’m in a different state because of the subtle changes in the environment. I grew up in Colorado and when I’d drive into Nebraska, I’d suddenly be surrounded by cornfields. When I crossed into Utah I’d find myself in sandstone canyon country. New Mexico was nothing but desert, cactus and adobe, and Wyoming was filled with nothing as far as the eye could see. I never knew if I was just imagining it or whether it was really happening.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar thing happened when I turned forty. Something changed. I felt as though I had crossed an invisible border of some kind. All of a sudden, my metabolism slowed down and I couldn’t eat as much as I used to. My body felt a little more tired after my runs. And, everything seemed like it took a bit more effort. It didn’t seem fair… all I had done was turn forty!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back on that decade, I can now see that those changes were real, and not imaginary. I had indeed crossed into new territory. So, as someone who’s “been there and done that,” here are some helpful observations of what to expect when you cross that “state line.”</span>

<strong>Here are the four biggest changes that can happen in your 40’s, along with some suggestions for how to best respond:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You notice a difference in the way your</span><b> brain</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works
</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You notice your </span><b>metabolism</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slowing down
</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s more difficult to build and maintain </span><b><b>muscle mass
</b></b></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You start to feel your </span><b>joints</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more and notice your </span><b>range of motion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> diminishing
</span></span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Mental Fitness</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After turning forty you might notice your reasoning skills slowing down. Along with that, your memory will lose some of its crispness, so you find yourself keeping lists or calendars of important items or events. You might also notice that your verbal fluency doesn’t have the same edge, like not being able to always find the best word to describe an idea you’re trying to get across.<img class="wp-image-8416 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/selective-focus-portrait-photo-of-woman-in-red-t-shirt-3148937-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="469" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These mental changes happen subtly at first but will increase as you move farther into your fourth decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the upside, there are some things that actually improve. Other types of cognition, such as moral decision making, regulating emotions, and reading social situations are the byproducts of the wisdom that comes from trial and error… learning from your mistakes. I spent a lot of time in my forties working to move beyond the plethora of mistakes I made in my 20’s and 30’s. As I got older, I became increasingly tired of doing face plants, which forced me to get smarter, wiser and preventive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, even though most forty-year-olds don’t feel a drastic drop in their mental abilities, here are some things you can do to combat the onset of any mental decline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your brain in good shape by spending some time every day exercising your ability to focus your mind. The mindful focuses of ChiRunning and ChiWalking are the best ways to engage your mind with your body. As you pay attention to how your body is moving, those neural-transmitters in your brain are firing. It’s like weightlifting for the brain! My recommendation is to take walk breaks during your day and use the time to closely watch some aspect of your body movement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also keep your brain active by doing mentally challenging things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using your mind to focus on your body </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">while</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving your body is THE BEST way to maintain cognitive function. You can also keep your brain in great shape by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learning a new hobby or skill, learning a new language or musical instrument, or any activity that involves both your mind and body.</span>
<h2><b>Physical Fitness</b></h2>
<h3><b>For Women</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-3310 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ladies-legs-in-running-shoes-ChiRunning-for-WomenWomens-Bodies-Womens.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="435" />Women in their mid-forties sometimes begin to move into perimenopause. The female body begins to produce less estrogen, which can negatively affect calcium levels and reduce bone mass.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to counteract the potential loss in bone density and avoid osteoporosis in your fifties is to keep running and walking as weight-bearing exercises for healthy bones. If you haven’t already, it’s a great time to start weight-training, yoga, Pilates, walking with hand weights, or signing up for 10K or half marathon training programs. There are also nutritional supplements to help balance the hormones that help keep your bones strong.</span>

<img class="alignright wp-image-8419 " src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/29420018_s.jpg" alt="Physiotherapist measuring active range of motion of older patient's lower limb using manual goniometer" width="576" height="433" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, also that as we age there is a tendency to reduce our physical activity. This will eventually limit the range of motion in your joints and if you </span>don’t maintain good movement habits, you could be in danger of arthritis. The best policy to follow is, “Move it or lose it.” So, make friends with any activity that keeps your muscles toned and your joints loose. Go for short walks, stretch or do body looseners multiple times each day.
<h3><b>For Men</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Men in their forties begin to start producing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> testosterone, the hormone that helps build and maintain muscle mass. When paired with a slowing in metabolism (usually around 45), it often shows up as weight gain and loss of muscle tone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-8421 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/48712171_m.jpg" alt="Diet. Young Woman Standing On Weighing Scale And Holding Chocolate Bar. Sweets Are Unhealthy Junk Food. Sugar Is Bad For Health. Dieting, Healthy Eating, Lifestyle. Weight Loss. Top View" width="483" height="322" />The Chi approach to maintaining good muscle tone is to make sure you are adding either speed intervals or hills to your weekly running routine. Short accelerations of up to 2 minutes (with a 30 sec. jog break) are an easy way to strengthen your upper body muscles. Holding more of a forward fall and keeping a vigorous arm swing going is a perfect way to get both cardio/aerobic exercise and increase tone in your arms, shoulders, chest, back, and abs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also when it’s time to maintain your muscle mass with upper-body resistance training like TRX, free weights, or cross-training. This should be accompanied by a regular stretching routine to maintain good mobility in your shoulders, spine, and hips throughout your forties. As I suggested for women, you can do yoga, Pilates or t’ai chi to build good strength and ROM in your muscles and joints.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For both sexes, it’s also a time to take a good look at any vices that are diminishing your health, like smoking, drinking, poor diet choices and not enough sleep. All of these things, if not moderated, can deteriorate your immune system and lower your body’s ability to fight off illness and the effects of aging. Your forties are a great time to drop unhealthy habits and replace them with activities that ensure a vibrant and healthy lifestyle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have lots of forty-year-olds who come to us looking for ways to sustain a mentally and physically healthy life. And all the principles we’ve borrowed from T’ai Chi, and applied to ChiWalking and ChiRunning, are a perfect way to guide yourself through this crucial decade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling idea of aging well is “mindfulness.” By paying closer attention to everything you do, doing more of the right things and limiting some of the less healthy things, you’ll be guaranteeing yourself many more years of great mental health and physical vibrancy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best things the Chi approach has to offer is to engage your mind to improve the technique of moving your body, instead of relying so much on strength. Instilling good movement habits will more than makeup for any loss in muscle mass as you move on toward your fifties. And, paying close attention to how your body moves and feels will give you a great skill set that will serve you for many more decades.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important thing to remember as you age is to keep your CHI FLOWING; doing movement that is not forced, but guided by balancing the needs of your body with its capacity to do. THAT is truly vitalizing...</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Are Runners at Risk of Developing a Heart Condition?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>American Heart Month: Are Runners at Risk of Developing a Heart Condition?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may already know, February is American Heart Month– an opportunity to learn about the risks associated with different heart conditions that can affect anyone– even runners. Below, we’ve compiled three heart-health questions you should ask yourself, especially if you believe that running alone will prevent you from developing a heart-related condition. </span>
<h2><b>How’s your diet?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As runners, it is important that we use food as fuel since so much of our energy is burned during a run. Sometimes, we indulge in foods we really shouldn’t with the notion that we’ll just burn it all off during our next run. In order to </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/avoid-these-foods-for-a-healthier-heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid heart disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> caused by high cholesterol and blood pressure, try to limit your consumption of red meats, white bread and pasta, processed foods (think: most foods that you buy in a premade package), and sugary sweets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-8476 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/abundance-agriculture-bananas-batch-264537-scaled.jpg" alt="bright colored, fresh produce- eggplant, carrots, cherries, bananas, oranges, green bell peppers " width="516" height="388" />Get in the habit of reading nutrition labels. You’ll likely be surprised at the amounts of sugar, simple carbs, and sodium in many foods that are marketed as “healthy.” Limiting these foods and replacing them with organic whole fruits, veggies, greens, and grains may seem simple, but it is an area that many people struggle with and could benefit greatly from switching. If you are early on in your running journey and are looking to adopt healthier eating habits that fuel your body better, don’t feel as though you have to do it on your own. Rather than feeling overwhelmed on your own, join a </span><a href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community-based weight loss program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn how to make lasting changes to your diet and nutrition. Just as it helps to learn running endurance with a group, you may find it equally beneficial when it comes to learning what consists of a healthy diet!  </span>
<h2><b>Are you getting enough rest?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a runner, knowing when to rest (and actually following through with it) is crucial for many reasons. Of course, excess running without proper rest and stretching can result in stress fractures, shin splints, and plantar fasciitis. But, did you know that excessive running can actually cause your heart tissue to thicken? Among other issues, this could possibly lead to atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat. <img class="wp-image-8479 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stretching-muscles-579122_1280.jpg" alt="runner stretching quadraceps" width="602" height="330" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though endurance exercise, like marathon running, reduces the long-term risk of developing heart issues, it can in fact raise the risk of developing them in the short term. During a marathon, about </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/well/move/does-marathon-running-increase-the-risk-of-cardiac-arrest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 in every 57,000 participants will experience cardiac arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are low odds, but the risk is still there. To keep yourself safe, get plenty of rest between big runs and pay close attention to the messages your body is sending you. Seek medical attention if you notice a change in how you feel while running, such as a tightness or pressure in the chest, pain or numbness in your arms and legs, or feeling faint and light-headed. </span>
<h2><b>Do you know your family history?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the healthiest person can be at risk of developing a heart condition if there is a family history of it. Though genetic predispositions can be controlled significantly with a proper diet and regular exercise– the risk remains. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.cardiosecur.com/magazine/specialist-articles-on-the-heart/heart-attack-genetic-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of the risk for cardiovascular disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results from a genetic predisposition. <img class=" wp-image-8482 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/robina-weermeijer-sAHiIKGKjjA-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="model of a heart dissected " width="366" height="549" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get ahead of any possible cardiac issues, gather as much medical information as you can from your parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. After all, knowledge is power and the further back you can gather health data, the better. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to share your findings with your general physician and take any preventive measures possible. These will include maintaining healthy body weight by eating a healthy mix of whole foods, as the risk for heart disease doubles in individuals with risk genes who also have unhealthy eating habits. On top of eating risk, living a healthy lifestyle by staying active (but not overdoing it) and seeing your doctor for regular heart checks can keep your heart healthy and strong for years to come.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In honor of American Heart Month, take the time to assess your heart disease risk and take one preventative step to keep yourself healthy and strong! </span>

		<title><![CDATA[March 2020 Instructor of the Month: Ken Presutti]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></h2>
<img class=" wp-image-8244 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ken-presutti.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="516" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I'm Ken! A Coach and Trainer based in Pittsburgh, PA, with clients across the globe. I'm passionate about running, cycling, triathlon, and health. When I’m not coaching athletes, I’m coaching technology teams on being more agile with Scrum, Kanban, and a DevOps approach to building software. At home, I have an amazingly supportive wife, Kelly, an awesome little son named Jax, and a few dogs!</span>

<b>How did you start running?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was never a great athlete as a kid, but one day I decided I needed to play a sport and jumped into soccer. I didn’t realize how much running I’d be doing. That lead to me joining the track team in the spring and taking up indoor cycling to condition for both. </span>

<b>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </b><b>(The short story.)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I met a lot of friends and eventual clients and training partners by working as a cycling instructor. That leads to more personal training and run coaching (the old fashion way… you know “oh, a marathon… okay go run this many miles this fast, this often”). I knew I had to help clients with form, and in exploring how to help them, discovered on ChiRunning.</span>

<b>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning has definitely helped me stay injury-free, and actually run the marathon portion of the Ironman! But, beyond just the mechanics, ChiRunning has helped me be more mindful in all things. </span>

<b>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That it’s for older runners, or those not worried about speed. The fastest runners in the world all share similar characteristics in their technique. ChiRunning is a great way to naturally find and enhance those characteristics in your own from. Get your from down, and the speed will come!</span>

<b>What motivates you to run? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with other athletes, or those that don’t even consider themselves athletes, and watch them become the best version of themselves through sport.</span>

<b>What achievements are you most proud of? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both working with older athletes, helping them achieve their first-time Ironman finishes, injury-free, as well as working with younger athletes to realize their potential both on and off the track.</span>

<b>What led you to become an instructor?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was already coaching runners and wanted to help them in every way possible. I heard about ChiRunning on a podcast, and immediately felt drawn to the program. I read the book in just over a day and signed up for instructor training a week later!</span>

<b>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an instructor and coach, I’m able to work with athletes at all skill levels. I love seeing first-time race finishes cross the line, watching high school kids finish in the top of their divisions at state championships, and helping others just get moving. I’m grateful that all my athletes can clients teach me just as many lessons as I teach them.</span>

<b>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I usually get 2-3 personal runs in (that means going for speed). Then, I usually have another 5-10 hours I rack up running with clients, packing long runs, etc. Outside of that, I’m keeping focused on my bike and swim, as I spend a lot of time racing triathlon.</span>

<b>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely biking and swimming. When it’s possible, I try to make sure I’m strength training 2-3 days per week. Yoga is by far, my all-time favorite activity, I just never seem to find time to make it to the mat!</span>

<b>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a practice, and there’s a lot to learn. Take your time and enjoy the ride. Also, if you just take away the biomechanical aspect of the technique, you’ll be in great shape. That said, don’t underestimate the mindfulness that comes with it. Learn a little more about Chi, make one run a week a moving meditation, use ChiRunning to complement your life, not make it more stressful.</span>
<h2><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO. </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite race you’ve run and why:</strong> Savageman Triathlon because it’s just brutal and you need a good technique to complete it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race:</strong> Ironman Lousiville because it was my first IM</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> Hot, 90 and humid over 35 and snowing any day</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Circular strides to the rear</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> Anywhere outdoors in the sun</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> Ice-cream and Beer (not necessarily in that order)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Ironman Maryland for an IM PR</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> It all depends, usually with</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> Anything from the Killers, currently AWOL Nation “The Best” is also on heavy rotation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t run I</strong>  would swim and bike more!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I can’t run without</strong> a clear head! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My first race was</strong> a 1 or 2 mile high school track event and I questioned if I really wanted to be a runner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is</strong> Altra Escalante 1.5 and 2. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I’ve ran</strong> a lot marathons/races (honestly, I try not to keep count).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> is a 26.2 marathon in Pittsburgh and Disney World. The farthest self-powered distance though would be Ironman for a total of 140.6 miles (in Louisville, KY).</span>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Progress, Not Perfection</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Written by Haley Tunstall, Communications Director of ChiLiving, Inc.</strong></em></p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-8507 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/progress-1.png" alt="progress vs perfection definition" width="1000" height="300" />

"Sorry, I'm only human!" <span style="font-weight: 400;">This commonly used expression implies that humans are inherently flawed– a direct contradiction to the definition of perfection. While we all know this to be true, many of us still strive for perfection. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to attain this unattainable quality inevitably sets us up for failure. Yet, we still fall into this trap. </span><img class="wp-image-8512 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wisdom-92901_1280.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="340" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In ChiRunning, one of the key principles is Gradual Progress: the step-by-step approach. Everything must grow incrementally, from less to more, through its own developmental stages, from smaller to larger. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it's the best model for succesful growth. Growth must happen gradually so that each step forms a stable foundation for the next step. If you skip steps, you’ll experience a negative effect on the process or the product/outcome. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple example of this: You’re building a house, but you just can’t wait to move in already! So, you decide to skip the step of pouring a foundation to speed up the process. Ultimately, what happens? Cracks in drywall. Crooked doors and windows. Uneven floors. Your house crumbles! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, good posture is the foundation of ChiRunning, which can never be perfect as we move moment to moment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Explained like this, it may seem like a no-brainer! But how many times have you set a goal for yourself expecting to skip to the perfect end-goal without being present along the way?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only perfection is to be mindfully present during the process. By striving for perfection in any other sense is to not be present. <strong><em>The pursuit of perfection denies you the beauty in the journey. </em></strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially for athletes, perfectionism is the enemy! This certainly rings true for ChiRunners and ChiWalkers. Not only does perfectionism plague people to give up or not even start, but it puts many runners at risk for a number of issues: <img class=" wp-image-8517 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sage-friedman-TT2J5t1QaMw-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="490" /> </span>
<ul>
 	<li>Leads to overtraining</li>
 	<li>Increases risk for injury</li>
 	<li>Retards proper recovery</li>
 	<li>Risk physical or mental burnout</li>
 	<li>Decreases performance levels</li>
 	<li>Harms mental/emotional health</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Workshops, we often observe participants trying to get everything perfect, all at once. As we try to get runners to relax, they typically become very tense trying to relax <em>correctly</em>. Their need to perfect this focus works against their end-goal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfectionism doesn’t align with the Chi-mindset: Establish a link of communication between the mind and body– and the process becomes the goal!</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is the goal! There are many more great benefits of ChiRunning, but I want to make the point that the ChiRunning method is holistic, which means that each of the components of the technique contributes positively to the whole by supporting the others to do their job. This aspect of the ChiRunning method also ensures that you don’t have to become an expert in all of the components right away. I’ve had clients benefit enormously from just one hour of learning how to improve their posture. Any single component will benefit your running, and when all of the components are working together, the effects can be nothing short of transformational.
(Excerpt from page 24 of <em>ChiRunning</em>)</span></blockquote>
<strong>On your next run, remember: It's progress, not perfection; the process is the goal! </strong>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Coronavirus Protection that </b><b><i>No One’s</i></b><b> Talking About… </b></h1>
<em><strong>Written by: <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is anything we need to learn from COVID-19 it is that maintaining a healthy immune system is the most important thing when it comes to staving off the most devastating effects of this virus and of most illnesses. It is our first line of defense. <img class=" wp-image-8556 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-4810201_1280.jpg" alt="coronavirus over crowd of people" width="489" height="326" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viruses are opportunistic. They thrive where the immune system is weakest. Yes, your immune system can be compromised, sometimes due to lifestyle habits and sometimes through no fault of your own, but there is much we can and need to be doing to help our immune system cultivate its defensive capabilities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not too late to begin! Start taking a few actions every day to build your immunity now. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Western medicine comes to our rescue for many health issues, but the truth is, real health comes from our lifestyle including how we eat, how we think and manage stress, and how and how much, we move our bodies. </span>
<h2><b>Build your Immunity with ChiWalk-Run</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During these stressful times, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/get-started/walk-to-run/">ChiWalk-Run method</a> for a gentle movement that keeps your immune system functioning at a high level without compromising it by overstressing your body. As Runner’s World says: “A run can build your immune system but a marathon can potentially weaken it.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the NY Times: “Continuing to be inactive...can decrease immune function. On the other end of the spectrum, very demanding exercise can also lead to immune impairment.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we all feel the approach of Spring and warmer running weather ahead, now is not the time to push your body to its limits. Body Sense, and let your body move when it needs to, but also be aware of when you are pushing too hard. No matter what, movement is absolutely crucial to building your immune system. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-3308 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/group-of-chirunnerschiwalkers-practice-chiwalk-to-run-with-danny-dreyer-ChiRunningWalk-to-Run3-key-focuses-for-beginners.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="369" />Depending on your fitness level, the <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/chiwalk-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChiWalk-Run program</a> offers something for everyone. If you have been somewhat sedentary this Winter, start with ChiWalking. It is the safest way to get moving. If at some point your body needs a bit more than just walking, you can add in short spurts of ChiRunning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a runner who is just getting back into running after a Winter hiatus, <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/chiwalk-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChiWalk-Run</a> is the perfect way to slowly build your running program without weakening your immune system. Remember, this is not the time to challenge your immune system with intense race training, but a time to strengthen it with responsive care for your body and its well-being. ChiWalk-Run requires Body Sensing and paying close attention to what is too little and too much while offering you a method of movement that gradually builds your conditioning as it builds your immune system. </span>
<h2><b>Keep that Chi Flowing</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stagnant energy is where viruses find a home. Breathing, getting your blood pumping, practicing good posture - all the components of ChiWalking and ChiRunning -  will keep your chi flowing and your immune system functioning at a higher level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You would never think of running 3 or 4 times a day, but it is totally appropriate to take several shorter walks. </span>
<h2><b>Your Body and your Immune System Need Fresh Air</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for fresh air should not be minimized. It comes across as a platitude, something your mother would say to you when she needed some quiet. Your body needs movement </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fresh air as much as possible. <img class=" wp-image-8568 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/woman-2827317_1280.jpg" alt="woman walking on trail outside" width="490" height="328" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems we’ve become afraid of the hot and the cold and we tend to stay indoors, far too much. I walk every single day. But only on days when the weather is perfect do I see many people out joining me. A little rain, or a dip into colder temperatures, and I have the trails practically to myself, except for a few dog walkers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh air is crucial to your immune system. Outdoor air is much cleaner and more deeply oxygenating than indoor air, even in most cities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides opening your windows regularly, even for a short time when it is really cold, the solution is to go outdoors. Danny and I sleep with an open window all year round and we are outside getting fresh air many times during the day: we do a longer, outdoor walking or running workout in the morning, a shorter walk after dinner, and mini walks and fresh air breaks during the day. This is how we live. </span>
<h2><b>Additional Immune Support</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to getting your body moving (gently) and getting plenty of fresh air here are a few additional suggestions to help build your immune system:   </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop eating sugar, it’s the number one culprit in weakening your immune system. It’s a brutal addiction, but giving it up, or at least minimizing sugar will go a long way in helping your immune system get stronger. This includes sweetener substitutes. Eat fresh or frozen fruit if you have a sugar craving. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get plenty of rest, and make sleep a priority; take naps if you need to. Turn off all screens at least an hour before bed, read a book instead and do whatever it takes to prepare yourself for a good night’s sleep. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take vitamin C. We use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I4CAYM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000I4CAYM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chiru08-20&amp;linkId=81c5abe2f146d4076fc3f12920d4926a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutribiotic's Hypo-Aller C Powder</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chiru08-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000I4CAYM" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. It’s buffered and has no added sweeteners. Take it in small doses several times a day. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most common natural ways to boost the immune system include: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(pick a few, more is not necessarily better)</span>

Neither Danny nor I, are licensed, health practitioners. </em></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage your stress. That sounds almost like a joke right now. We’re in a financial and health crisis around the world and we’re asking you to manage your stress. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. This is the perfect storm that can drive you deeper into what matters most: your health, your family, your neighbors, a healthy environment. This is a time when stressing over the small things goes out the window and becoming aware of your great capacity for living life meaningfully can be awakened. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good time to spend some quiet time, become more aware of reactionary responses and learn tools such as meditation to calm the mind and enrich the spirit.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat well.<strong><img class=" wp-image-8572 alignright" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salad-2756467_1280.jpg" alt="salad components laid out on table" width="482" height="322" /></strong> This is not a time for quick junk food, but for deep nourishment. Soups and broths should be prepared and frozen in case you do get sick.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be grateful for what you have and compassionate toward others. This will help your body and your being feel so much better. Just think of someone or something you love for 1 minute and see how you feel. Nothing is more deeply nourishing than love. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will write more in the coming weeks about health and healing. Meanwhile, we’re so grateful to the Chi community, our Certified Instructor and our amazing customers who all help keep the Chi flowing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish for all of us to get through this crisis with healthy bodies and open, healthy hearts. </span>

		<title><![CDATA[Healthy habits every man should practice regularly]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy habits every man should practice regularly</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting a healthy lifestyle, particularly during the current circumstances can be a tall task for any man. Especially in light of social distancing and self-isolation, it can be difficult for many men to forget about their health and neglect to make healthy lifestyle choices. However, if you’re struggling to hold on to your healthy habits, or are looking to implement some to change up your life, look no further. Here are some concepts any man should introduce and maintain in their life.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise regularly</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every man should be exercising consistently in order to be working out their muscles and the cardiovascular system. Running in particular is </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/health-benefits-of-running-2018-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a core fundamental exercise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that every man should be doing at least once a week. Not only does running help improve heart health, but it also can boost your immune system, endurance, mental strength, and overall energy. The beauty of running too is the ability to implement it without having to go to the gym! A great way to take a break from your self-quarantine efforts is to go outside and run around for a half-hour to an hour. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, if you’re looking for more tips and tricks on how you can improve everything from your running form to best practices, check out all our tips </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/category/beginners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat healthier meals</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve seen a drop in your energy and are looking to start leading a healthier life, you may want to rethink the foods you’re putting into your body. Dieting is a huge healthy habit that every man should be constantly tweaking in order to be feeling their best. As you mix in exercise along with your meals, think about what would make a good combination. Fruits and vegetables are obvious choices to include, but other hidden gems like nuts, eggs, and oats are fantastic ways to consume protein and strengthen the fibers of your muscles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more tips on mastering the art of eating well, check out another one of our guides </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/the-art-of-eating-well/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect their skin</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even while being inside for the time being, it’s still important that men are properly taking their skin. Personal hygiene can be easily neglected with self-isolation and social distancing, but it’s important to practice on a daily basis and can combat physical signs of aging. Every man’s skin requires certain nutrients and ingredients to keep it elastic and glowing, but many don’t know where to start. Here are some of our go-to tips:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you clean your face regularly with </span><a href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/men-care/face-care/face-wash.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a face wash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will clean your pores thoroughly.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When washing, start with splashing your face with warm water to open your pores and alleviate dirt sitting on your face. This is essential for softening your skin before you begin washing. Next, apply the wash and scrub in circular motions in order to boost blood circulation throughout the skin. This circulation helps with the regulation of your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lymphatic system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finish by rinsing soap with cold water to close pores and prevent new grime from entering your skin.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you shave your facial hair, do so diligently and invest in </span><a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us/shop/shave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proper skin-protecting razors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exfoliate your face at least once a week in order to remove dead skin cells and promote health skin cell growth.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit doctors regularly</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s particularly hard to be able to see a doctor during this pandemic, men should regularly be visiting their doctors for normal checkups in order to avoid any medical hiccups that could come down the road. </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-so-many-men-avoid-doctors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that almost two thirds of men totally avoid going to the doctor at all costs, and some even withhold valuable information from their doctors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember that as you live and as you age, you should remember to keep and maintain an honest and open conversation with your immediate doctors. While many men can view going to the doctor as a knock to their masculinity, these visits are great ways to receive healthy recommendations about your life and help coach your life forward.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As everyone battles a homebody lifestyle during this time period, there are certainly ways every man can be constantly improving their health through their lifestyle choices. Being healthy is definitely a mindset and requires some commitment, but is worth it in the long run. We hope these tips will help you in your fitness and health journey for years to come. </span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[July 2020 Instructor of the Month: Joel Matalon]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: July 2020</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Joel Matalon</h2>
<b><img class=" wp-image-8789 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Joel-Matalon.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="355" />Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I currently reside in Clifton, NJ just outside NYC where I “grew” up until age 45. I’m married to Birmania Matalon and am a father to twins toddlers Sarah Juliana and Julian Israel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I lead continuing education for the fitness and wellness industry. As well am director of Wellness at Leaf Brands (company providing PPE to the United States) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My fitness/ wellness career began in 1986 while at Queens College University as a dance major and LaCrosse Division II player. My company JoeFitnessWorld began in 1986 and incorporated in 8/1/2001. </span>

<b>How did you start running? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I began running early. As the smallest kid in the hood. I had to run for my life so as to not get beat up by the bigger kids/adults. My father trained me to “stay hungry” and ‘fight’ for what I wanted. My love for soda was huge. So my dad said he’ll allow me to have a soda for every mile I ran. I’d run around the block (which was a mile) 2-3 x’s. After the 2nd soda, I had no more interest in soda. These days, I occasionally sip a diet coke for momentary childlike enjoyment, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on I’d envisioned marathoning and ironmaning when I became an adult. </span>

<b>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Danny Dreyer at the Boston Marathon in 2004. I was in a depression, due to knee re-construction, while at the same time securing a spot in the race. I was asked to represent NYC as an honored runner due to my philanthropic efforts and promotion for kid’s health in NYC. Danny led a seminar pre race day at the expo. I was sold instantly. With my energy renewed, I began my relationship with Danny and Chi Living that continues to this day. </span>

<b>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi alters my relationship to running on an ongoing basis. On days when I’m really Yang and on, I go with it. Conversely, on days when I’m yin, “not feeling it,” I go with the flow and take my time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running is a skill to hone where I strive to bring out the best Runner in me. My tag line is to “Run like you did as a kid” while running and practicing ChiRunning. I want my running to be graceful, rhythmic and energizing while I run into my 90’s! </span>

<b>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest misconception is that it's for “old people” and injured people and not for world class athletes. I work with pro triathletes and record holders and they practice ChiRunning techniques and ongoingly improve their running skills, times and distance while moving their muscles, molecules and mind in a whole new way each time they practice. </span>

<b>What motivates you to run? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My father. He used to run a 5k every day. I live out my interpretation of him every time I do my ChiRunning practice aka a run! </span>

<b>What achievements are you most proud of? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching ChiRunning in the Farfellas of Rio de Janeiro. It was an orphanage where I taught and played with purpose with the children. </span>

<b>What led you to become an instructor? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my calling. In 2004 when I was summoned to meet Danny Dreyer at the Boston Marathon expo, I knew it. I told him I’m taking this back to NY and am going to go global with it... And. I fulfilled this and continue to fulfill this. </span>

<b>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s given me a platform to travel globally, work with fortune 500 companies, orphanages and make a massive world difference. I fulfill my life purpose of racial harmony and equal play for all. </span>

<b>What does your average week look like, run-wise? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 miles per week </span>

<b>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">RUNhabX: Backwards to the Future Training. It is 5-9 miles forward running on hills plus one mile running backward on flats . </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speedball Fitness </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BodyARTFitness </span>

<b>Advice for people new to Chi Running? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on ‘be’ing a runner rather than ‘do’ing running. </span>
<h3><b>Short answer! Okay, GO. </b></h3>
<b>Most memorable race: </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Favorite race you’ve run and why: Spartan Stadium Race 2019 at CitiFIeld, NYC </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was in my hometown of Queens and I had a team of friends from childhood. My mission was to allow the Chi within me to flow and keep a smile on my face throughout. I fulfilled that and made many friends along the course. Even with helping the team through tough obstacles, I placed 3rd in my age range and 13th overall! </span>

<b>Ideal weather for running: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like running in the heat 90 degrees or more. </span>

<b>Focus that currently dominates your running</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ankle lift, peel my feet off the ground as if they’re a stamp on a stamp role. </span>

<b>Favorite place to run: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Park in New York </span>

<b>Go-to before race food: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oatmeal, coffee protein powder, almond milk </span>

<b>Celebratory food after: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">steak, broccoli rabe and a bottle of red wine, </span>

<b>Upcoming race/goal: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 NYC Marathon running backward the whole course. </span>

<b>Run with or without phone/music</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Run listening to podcasts, audiobooks and occasionally music </span>

<b>Repeat on your playlist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prosperous Coach </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t run...</strong> I’d likely die from lack of breath. Be depressed, depleted, devoid of energy </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I can’t run without...</strong> permission from my wife and twins. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My first race (marathon) was...</strong> the 1996 Long Island Marathon and I felt accomplished while also feeling exhausted and overheated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is...</strong> Nike Vapor </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was...</strong> the 2007 NYC Marathon. It was rainy and my feet were soaked. I was pacing to finish under 2:59:05 until mile 23 along Central Park’s 5th Avenue. The blisters on my feet felt like painful water balloons as I dragged myself to the finish. However, my time ended at 3:33:17 which is my fastest marathon time </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I’ve run...</strong> 30 marathons and 55 races overall </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The longest distance I’ve run...</strong> is 37 miles around Central Park 9x’s for their Central Park, New York Ultra Marathon. </span>]]></content>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At his core, Marc is a teacher. As an education entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience he has served in the roles of coach, teacher, school founder, school leader, mindfulness educator, and executive director.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc is an avid runner with regular podium finishes. In his forties he ran a 2:51 PR in the Boston Marathon and successfully completed 50-mile ultramarathons. Marc has been practicing ChiRunning for many years and credits it for his ability to run 2,500 injury-free miles every year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why he became a ChiRunning Instructor, Marc was quick to respond: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think of ChiRunning as a gift I received – a gift that has made my life better and more robust. I wanted to share this gift with others. Also, my entire professional career has been in public education – with a good part of that as a teacher and school leader. So, teaching ChiRunning was a great way to combine my passions – for ChiRunning and education…The people I work with are always so appreciative – they realize that they can do things with their bodies they didn’t know they could do. Giving people this gift is extremely rewarding.”</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Meet Jeff Carnivale</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-740 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/JeffandLiz.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="350" />As someone who grew up playing team sports, Jeff always found running to be a punishment. It was not until he was in his 30’s that he was convinced to try it as a “fun” activity. At the time, he was coaching cyclists for a century ride, teaching Pilates, as well as personal training a few clients. Even with a knowledge in fitness he was surprised how much practice it took for running to become easy and pain-free.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, I was motivated to become a ChiRunning instructor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to dig deeper for both myself and my clients. I wanted to help them train smarter and recover faster.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, posture, proprioception, and efficient movement are the cornerstones of all his fitness and wellness teachings from kids to seniors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 20 years Jeff has trained dozens of running instructors and coached hundreds of athletes to success through a holistic look at health, fitness, &amp; running. Some of his clients have included:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shane Benzie – Running Reborn Founder Author of “The Lost Art of Running “ and world traveling running coach and researcher, Erin (Sutton) Scott Winner 2012 Nashville Country music marathon and ultra-runner, and Will Rivera – Owner &amp; Coach at Running Soles and a nationally ranked ultra-runner who has won distances from marathon to 100 miles.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Meet Angela James</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-997 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/angelajames.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="440" />Angela James was always very active in sports in her native country of England. However, it wasn’t until about a decade after immigrating to Canada that she broadened her fitness horizon to include marathon running. Since then, Angela has traveled the world completing many marathons, including the Boston Marathon in 2004. While recovering from a dreaded case of Achilles Tendonitis, Angela began reading Co-Founder, Danny Dreyer’s book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book led her to enroll in a workshop with Danny, who instantly inspired her to take that next step.  Angela James has been a ChiRunning instructor since 2009. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is incredibly rewarding to share the knowledge, knowing that it can change lives! I love the fact that ChiRunning is international! Because traveling is dear to my heart, ChiRunning has opened up many travel opportunities as an instructor.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Angela has been able to apply the principles of ChiRunning to all aspects of her life even beyond fitness, and thrives because of it.</span>

He has competed in races in the United States, Africa, Australia, and all across Europe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lloyd has been coaching athletes since 2004 and makes it very clear that form and technique are of the utmost importance when training. This driving principle coupled with the ability to truly differentiate himself as the coach who takes the suck out of running are why he became a Certified Chi Running and Chi Walking Instructor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this focus on training, Lloyd has been able to help athletes of all levels achieve their goals from running a 5k to finishing a marathon or triathlon. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Meet Constanza Lisdero</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-9246 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/constanza-3.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="426" />Switzerland-based instructor, Constanza Lisdero says she was never into running as a kid or young adult although she used it to warm-up for other activities.  Despite an extremely active life-style that included sailing, hiking, biking and rock-climbing, an easy, pain-free run beyond 3 miles eluded her. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her frustration with running compelled her to take up competitive swimming in an effort to work her way up to running. Still dissatisfied, she turned to the internet. A search for “good running mechanics”, led Constanza to a ChiRunning workshop. Once she learned the technique, running became unbelievably easy and effortless – at any distance, even marathons! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With running no longer feeling like a chore, Constanza was inspired to help others run easy and pain-free as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to improve people’s lives through movement, walking and running. I want to spread the good run.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry on, Constanza!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2005, Steve became a ChiRunning Instructor because he realized the power associated with mindful movement. He was just starting his triathlon and marathon coaching career and wanted to be able to offer something that other training systems didn’t have, ChiRunning. Teaching a running form that focused on the physical aspects of running, but more importantly, emphasized the importance of mindfulness was critical and life changing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I made [ChiRunning a] part of my full-time job. It has taken me all over the United States and world, meeting people, running races, giving seminars and helping change many people’s lives. Becoming a ChiRunning Instructor offers so many rewarding experiences -- it can literally change your life. I have had many of my students become ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructors. Going through the instructor training doesn’t mean you have to become an instructor or coach.  You can also go through the training for a deeper understanding of your mind/body connection that is ChiRunning.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from being a Certified ChiRunning/ChiWalking® Instructor, Steve is a Certified Hypnotherapist, Certified Personal Trainer, USA Triathlon Coach, USA Cycling Coach, Certified Massage Therapist, FIST Bike Fitter, Lululemon Ambassador and Yoga teacher. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Meet Sarah Richardson</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-7340 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="382" />Growing up in the rural outskirts of New York City, Sarah Richardson has always incorporated fitness into her life. Whether it was running on the beach or a trail, she developed a great love for the outdoors. Luckily for Sarah, she experienced very few injuries during her early running career. However, during an adventure race, she literally stumbled into a severe, acute ankle injury. That one incident led to more injuries which just sucked the fun out of running for her. The pain and frustration of not being able to run, eventually prompted Sarah to attend a clinic hosted by Danny Dreyer. That served as her first introduction to ChiRunning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to figure [out why I was having so many issues running], I went to a ChiRunning clinic with Danny in Boston and before the end of the day, I was “cured.” I knew why my body was responding the way it was and experienced immediate relief and was able to get back to running! By the end of the day I was so happy and asked how I could teach it to other people because it was just BRILLIANT!!!”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She continues to find joy in her running, especially when she is teaching the ChiRunning technique. She loves helping fellow runners bounce back from injuries, in a safe and effective manner.  ...And she learns from them as well! Like many ChiRunning instructors, she has had the wonderful opportunity to travel and share the ChiRunning concepts across the globe.</span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Meet Lisa Pozzoni</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-1093 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Lisa2018pic.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="335" />After being laid off from her job in 2005, Lisa Pozzoni began working with a personal trainer to get back into shape. She witnessed first-hand the positive effects of fitness, so she decided to ditch the corporate world in pursuit of a career as a fitness trainer.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years later, she developed a casual interest in running, and was gifted a copy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a client. That led her to take a workshop, and like many of our instructors, she fell in love with the practice. She immediately decided to become an instructor.  What stands out about Lisa, however, is her decision to </span><b>GO ALL IN</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on ChiRunning. Essentially leaving her personal training life behind, Lisa pivoted once again to open up her own business as a </span><b>full-time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ChiRunning instructor and coach – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and she has never looked back!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa went from being a “Never Runner,” to an Ultra Runner thanks to the techniques and body mechanics emphasized in ChiRunning. As a ChiRunning Instructor, she re-lives that thrill of accomplishment every time she helps someone achieve goals that they never thought possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The look on peoples’ faces when they cross that [finish] line not thinking they could do it inspires me every day.  Knowing I can help people get back to doing what they love to do if they were injured or helping beginners learn to do it the right way the first time around keeps me going!”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the possibility of becoming a ChiRunning or ChiWalking instructor appeals to you -- even if you are new to the technique -- <a href="https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/form/54a021b3e5bc62c75c71e0b1b8ba3db0">click on this link to be notified of when our next ChiRunning and Chi Walking Instructor Training program is open for registration.</a></span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Can you make your program more flexible?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>OMG you guys!!</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we asked for your feedback on what was the ONE THING you would need to make joining us inside the ChiRunning ChiWalking Instructor Training Program a no-brainer, you guys didn’t hold back!  Since so many of you responded, we decided to answer your top FIVE questions starting today in another email mini-series, saving the MOST ASKED question for LAST.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Most-asked Question:</span>

<b>“Can you make your program more flexible?” </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is “YES, Yes we can!!!” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And we are SO glad you asked because it gives us a chance to show off </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(just a little)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how we turned an already great program into something AMAZING! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The BC (before COVID) version of the ChiRunning ChiWalking Instructor Training Program featured a three-month, self-managed, home study course with an interactive workbook and DVDs.  Candidates practiced the lessons and scripts on friends to prepare for a four-day immersive weekend where Things. Got. REAL. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now SC (since COVID), the program has been adapted to still deliver the same quality, high-touch experience that ChiRunning is known for, while… </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respecting social distancing,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing for different learning modalities, and…</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing a lot more flexibility. </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned yesterday, the certification program will be an online- offline fusion education experience.  Home study with an interactive instructors’ manual will still be a part of it, of course, as will the three quizzes and the final. However, we’ve replaced the four-day CRCWIT weekend with weekly, 90-minute, </span><b>live </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">sessions over Zoom.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week will feature:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lesson, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An opportunity for Q &amp; A, and… </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time to chat with you fellow classmates. </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can’t make the live call? No problem! Each session will be recorded so you can access the replay.  But we strongly encourage you to attend as many of the 26 live, weekly sessions in person as you can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really FUN </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">part!  The last six hours of your 32-hour program are to be spent one on one with a Certifying Master Instructor.  You choose who, where and how.  For all you runners wanting 1:1 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-person training</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have the opportunity to meet with your Certifying Master Instructor </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in person</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for lessons, technique review and a video tape analysis of you running and teaching. (</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SIDE NOTE: These last two videos of you will be sent to ChiLiving by your Certifying Master Instructor as part of your final exam.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask that any social distancing or mask mandates be observed during your sessions.  Obviously, if COVID restrictions or your own personal comfort levels </span><b>prevent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the in-person instruction from taking place, the sessions can be moved to private, online instruction (with approval from ChiLiving). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you’re as excited by these program improvements as we are!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few days, we will tackle your other most pressing questions, so be sure to click on any emails you see from us!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the possibility of becoming a Chi Running or Chi Walking instructor appeals to you -- even if you are new to the technique -- <a href="https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/form/54a021b3e5bc62c75c71e0b1b8ba3db0">click on this link for notification of when the Chi Running and Chi Walking Instructor Training program is open for early registration!</a></span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Is it possible to start a ChiRunning business from zero especially when there is seemingly little demand for it in my area?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>Starting a Business</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the fourth most-asked question we received when we asked for your feedback </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">had to do with staring a business.  Mainly, “</span><b>Is it possible to start a ChiRunning business from zero especially when there is seemingly little demand for it in my area?” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the answer is yes, particularly NOW.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, know that our mission at ChiRunning is to help people enjoy running effortlessly and pain-free for life.  To ensure that, we developed a robust instructor training program that teaches…</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking principles and body mechanics on a very deep level. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to actually teach private and group lessons in person and online.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business development so you can start your own full or part-time career.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, part of your training will be to help you develop your action plan.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, after graduation, you’ll have access to our marketing resources and tools to help you build your business.  You’ll also have a strong alumni network that you can tap into for advice and opportunities.  Like the individuals we highlighted over the last two weeks, our instructors are very successful and happy to share their knowledge.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, the timing couldn’t be better.  The winter months and pandemic may keep us home a bit more, but the good news is that the number of runners is increasing exponentially! And where you live matters less and less when digital video apps like Facetime, Skype and Zoom bring people together from all over the world.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time to take advantage of these trends so </span><b>don’t wait!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for our next Chi Running and Chi Walking Instructor Training program officially opens </span><b>next Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Class sizes are SMALL to retain the personal, high-touch education that ChiRunning is known for so, </span><b>SPOTS ARE LIMITED!!!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get your ChiRunning/ChiWalking business off the ground as soon as possible, don’t wait.  Get on the waitlist </span><b>NOW,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we’ll open up registration early </span><b>just for you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the possibility of becoming a Chi Running or Chi Walking instructor appeals to you -- even if you are new to the technique -- <a href="https://nk149.infusionsoft.com/app/form/54a021b3e5bc62c75c71e0b1b8ba3db0">click on this link for notification of when the Chi Running and Chi Walking Instructor Training program is open for early registration!</a></span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How quickly can I earn back my investment in the CRCWIT Program?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>ROI as a ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructor</h1>
<b>“How quickly can I earn back my investment in the CRCWIT Program?”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the third most-asked question to our recent request for feedback.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great question. While it would be easy to simply say, it’s up to you, there really is a bit more to it than that.   First, it comes down to what your personal circumstances are and will allow.  Recognizing that not everything is within your control is key. Second, how are you measuring your return?  If it’s just about earning your money back, then it’s a simple math problem.  So, let’s dig into things:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed with which you can recover your investment in the CRCWIT program will depend on a few factors: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor 1: Time </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will ChiRunning be or be part of your primary source of income?  Or will you be maintaining your current non-running related occupation? How often and when you teach makes a difference.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much of your life do you want or can you devote to being a ChiRunning professional? If your desire is to travel the globe teaching ChiRunning and ChiWalking, know that your travel expenses will offset some of your earnings, thereby slowing your rate of return.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some CRCWIT graduates follow a transitional path starting out by maintaining current employment and training clients 2-3 times per week and over time, expanding their training time and income stream.  Others may choose to be more aggressive and actively begin running workshops and virtual sessions soon after receiving their certification</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor 2: Access to and Volume of Market Demand </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you currently a fitness professional with a list of clients who might be interested in private Chirunning sessions or even a group workshop?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you already have an established coaching practice with a developed on and offline marketing plan to attract more clients?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you expanding your reach through social media, a website or email list? These are all great ways to go beyond the confines of your location and attract more clients.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor 3: Price</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the flexibility to build your practice around your ChiRunning lifestyle, as well as access to a lot of potential clients, then the last piece of the ROI puzzle is price.  </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we can suggest a pricing range for private sessions and group workshops, Certified ChiRunning ChiWalking Instructors set their own prices.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price is determined by your local cost of living, how much people are willing to pay for the value you bring them, and what your potential competitors in the same or related fields are charging.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">From a monetary perspective, many ChiRunning ChiWalking Instructors earn back their investment in about three to six months doing what they want and love to do.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For other’s having the ability to help improve people’s lives through pain-free, effortless running is priceless.  For them, the program pays for itself on day one, or at the moment their first client crosses their very first finish line.  The return is not monetary.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, the CRCWIT certificate is a valuable credential. It represents both professional expertise and a commitment to excellence in teaching.  It will enable you to attract potential clients and build a client base as quickly as you would like. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for our next Chi Running and Chi Walking Instructor Training program officially opens </span><b>next Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Class sizes are SMALL to retain the personal, high-touch education that ChiRunning is known for so, </span><b>SPOTS ARE LIMITED!!!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get your ChiRunning/ChiWalking business off the ground as soon as possible, don’t wait.  Get on the waitlist </span><b>NOW,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we’ll open up registration early </span><b>just for you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

		<title><![CDATA[What happens after graduation? What’s next?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>POST GRADUATION -WHAT’S NEXT?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This email deals with the 2nd most-asked question about the ChiRunning ChiWalking Instructor Training (CRCWIT) program.  It makes sense. You spent the time reviewing which running instructor training program was best for you.  You figured out how long it would take to earn your investment back. The next logical question then becomes, </span><b>“What happens after graduation? What’s next?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRCWIT program is a thorough, rigorous experience that helps you… </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deepen your knowledge of ChiRunning and ChiWalking,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve your technical proficiency,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop your skills as a teacher, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help you develop a business. </span></li>
</ul>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Use Relaxed Alertness to Reduce Running Injury]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Use Relaxed Alertness to Reduce Running Injury</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>By </i></b><a href="http://www.berni-k.com"><b><i>Berni Kozlowski</i></b></a><b><i>, RYT-200, Certified Meditation Coach</i></b></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably know how to </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/3-tips-to-improve-your-chi-running-posture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">align your posture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/four-core-strengthening-exercises-to-improve-your-running1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engage your core</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you can run injury-free. And you probably understand the mind-body connection of a sustainable running practice, but what you might not know is how you can use a </span><a href="https://pages.berni-k.com/chirunning/"><b>simple and easy 10 minute meditation to enhance that connection.</b></a><b> </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run with relaxed muscles, you move with grace, ease, and awareness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a meditation coach and former runner, and when I was training for triathlons, I dealt with aches and pains because I was tensing up my whole body and pushing it past its limits. From then on, I became wiser about training more relaxed and finding more joy in the whole process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are constantly battling a racing mind, pushing harder but not going faster, you can feel like you’re not getting anywhere. If you are in your head so much that you aren’t even aware of your surroundings, your body will feel anxious.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And when the frustrations pile up, it can feel like you’re putting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more into your workout than you’re getting out of it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we’re feeling stressed or worried, that worry can lead directly to muscle tension, which dramatically increases your chances of injury while running. </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/blog/stress-reduction-made-easy/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress Reduction Made Easy</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how belly breathing and doing more fun runs can help relax those muscles and calm your mind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s a balance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are too relaxed, you may as well be taking a nap. But if you are focusing too hard, your body will tense up and you’ll increase your chances of injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to be more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relaxed in your mind, your breathing, and your surroundings.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move through your run and your world with relaxed alertness using discernment about what really needs effort, breathing more easily, and having great situational awareness. You’ll be faster and more flexible and your times will drop.</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You hear that the highest performing runners train more, train harder, or have just the right body type. You, on the other hand, have to suffer through plateaus, boredom, and injury for a few more years before you can get the results you want.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not quite true.</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are several key principles to getting the most out of your runs without suffering through boredom or unnecessary strain:</span>

<b>#1: Knowing how to deal with racing thoughts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affects your body physically and helps you have greater discernment about what really needs your energy.</span>

<b>#2: There are other ways to breathe besides breathing deeply. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need a breathing technique that works for others, you need one that works for you. It’s easier to breathe when you have more techniques in your toolkit. </span>

<b>#3: By opening your senses,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are re-wiring your brain to be more aware. You’ll move more gracefully with more enjoyment when you practice open awareness with your senses as much as you practice your running form.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine these attitudes, you’ll not only be a more efficient runner but you’ll build the reputation of being a graceful runner. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you get out of your head and move with </span><b><i>relaxed alertness</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your muscles will loosen, making you flexible and faster and more pleasantly present to the overall experience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This state of relaxed alertness involves three parts: your </span><b>mind</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your </span><b>breathing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and your </span><b>awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using your senses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do you actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that? Well…it’s simpler than you might think. Keep on reading, and then give it a try with </span><a href="https://pages.berni-k.com/chirunning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this free audio meditation download</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 Steps to Running with Relaxed Alertness</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Relax Your Mind</span></h3>
<b>First, give yourself permission to rest. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Say these words, and feel them in your belly: </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I give myself permission to rest.”</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you feel really restful? Or did you feel like there were racing thoughts? Or a feeling of agitation?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fine if you didn’t feel restful when you said it. Try doing it every day, and eventually you’ll become successful every time you do it.</span>

<b>It’s a myth that you need to stop your thoughts in order to rest.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest doesn’t mean an absence of thoughts––it means that you don’t have to fix or solve anything right now. There’s a myth in meditation that your mind has to be blank to be relaxed. Instead, when thoughts arise, try giving them some gentle attention and then letting them pass on by. This is different from trying to suppress or block or stop thoughts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel any agitation or struggle, add a few words to your statement like this: </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I give myself permission to rest. I welcome thoughts, I just don’t have to fix or solve or change anyone or anything right now.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People find that when they say these words with some meaning, their breathing slows or their bodies soften a little bit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can practice this while seated, walking, running, biking, or swimming! Experiment and pay attention to how it feels in your body.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was doing triathlons, I learned how to do drill work in the pool and reduced my times. Once I plateaued, I tried getting faster by pushing, by tensing my muscles more and I got slower! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I remembered my meditation training and said “I give myself permission to rest.”  Those laps felt so effortless I was convinced I was going slower until I checked my watch and my time had dropped! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Permission to rest is not about blocking or stopping or ignoring thoughts or emotions. Rest is welcoming them, letting them arise and receive some attention and go on their merry way without actively engaging.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome thoughts like welcoming a good friend. You can listen and give them attention, but you don’t have to solve their problems. Friends just want to be heard. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2. Relax In Your Breathing</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s more to breathing than just taking a deep breath. There are many subtleties of breathing that will tell your body to switch into the parasympathetic response. Here are several ways to make your breathing slower and softer and ultimately more efficient:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Nose breathing</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is better than mouth breathing. Most people are mouth breathers, which causes greater dehydration and you actually </span><a href="https://www.kymburls.com/post/7-reasons-to-breathe-with-your-nose"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extract up to 20% less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oxygen with each breath.   </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice the</span> <b><i>transition</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between your inhale and your exhale. Is it smooth or is there a delay or pause? Explore making that transition as smooth as possible.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b><i>longer exhale,</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a deep sigh, triggers the relaxation response. Notice the length of the inhale vs the exhale. If your inhale is longer than your exhale, you are likely stress breathing. </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try This:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inhale and tense your body for a second or two. Then exhale and try to tense your body again to about the same intensity. It’s harder to tense your muscles when you are exhaling.</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A longer exhale keeps your muscles more relaxed. As a softball coach, I learned that exhaling as you are about to field a ground ball keeps you more fluid and keeps your reactions fast. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When golfing, I used to inhale on the backswing and then hold my breath on the downswing. My arms would tense and the shot would be erratic. I found that if I  exhaled through the entire swing,  I could hit the ball farther, with more accuracy and less effort. </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Belly breathing. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathe normally and notice if you tend to breathe in the belly or higher up in the chest which stimulates the stress response.  Breathing in your belly triggers relaxation response receptors.  Being as gentle as possible, explore the gentle movement of your lower ribs lifting up and out. Feel or imagine your diaphragm lowering or your belly inflating. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Breathe less or breathe slower.</i></b><span> When you breathe slower the air stays in your lungs longer, allowing you to extract more oxygen with each breath. Slower breathing tells your nervous system things are ok!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore </span><b><i>passive breathing,</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you let go of controlling your breathing and allow your body to do it subconsciously. You breathe involuntarily when you’re asleep or unconscious. Go ahead and breathe like that, appreciating the magic that your body will fill with air and expel air all by itself with no input from you. Enjoy the quality of breathing softly and easily.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3. Relaxed Awareness</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I had meditative tools, I used to go for long hikes in the woods or for runs when I was doing triathlons, and I would use that time to think hard through some issue or problem in my life. I was stuck in problem-solving mode, and I might come out with a to-do list, but never deep Aha Moments or insights or a sense of rejuvenation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was lost in my head, I would often be startled by a noise in the woods or a runner approaching me on the trail. I would get startled and my heart rate would jump up and I’d feel rattled. When I move through the woods with greater awareness, I can hear or see the tiniest of movements and be ready for the unexpected. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are startled, we are unable to think clearly for up to 10 seconds. This is deadly for pilots or drivers of cars or for clear functioning during our days. Moving with greater ease puts us more in the flow. Not only are we faster and more flexible physically, but mentally and emotionally as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try This:</span>

<b>I am aware of </b><b><i>seeing</i></b><b>.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let go of control and let your eyes move wherever they want to go. You might notice colors or textures or shapes. Maybe you are drawn to the movement of leaves on the trees or the sight of a bird in flight. Maybe you are intrigued by the play of light and shadow on the path ahead.</span>

<b>I am aware of </b><b><i>hearing</i></b><b>.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be willing to be surprised by what you hear. Maybe your attention is caught by birdsong, or the sound of water in a stream, or by wind rustling in the trees. Maybe you hear musical or repetitive sounds. </span>

<b>I am aware of the </b><b><i>smell</i></b><b>.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just saying this statement will cause you to take in a fuller breath. Maybe you smell rain in the air, someone barbecuing, the smell of a lilac tree in the neighbor's yard, or the smell of wood fire from someone’s chimney. Take delight in what you smell and welcome any memories that may arise from these smells.</span>

<b>I am aware of </b><b><i>touch</i></b><b>. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of the touch of sun on my face. The breeze against my skin. The weight of my running clothes on my body. The touch of my feet against the earth.”</span>

<b>I am aware of the </b><b><i>space</i></b><b> beneath my feet and the space above my head.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes just opening one or two of your senses in this way is enough to get you out of your head and into the moment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then when I learned to move with more awareness, I was suddenly present to being in nature, and I came out with deeper ahas or insights or mental clarity and definitely more rested. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My swimming also improved when I would focus on a different sense every lap. I was amazed by the sight of bubbles formed as my hands moved through the water. Intrigued by the sounds of my breathing or the splashing of other swimmers. The silky touch of the water on my skin. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I went from being totally bored to having a child-like curiosity about being in the water.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows this flow:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relax in Your Mind</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Give Myself Permission to Rest. I don’t have to solve or fix or change anything right now.  </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relax in Your Breathing</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nose breathing/passive  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smooth transition  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer exhale  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slower/longer breaths  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belly breathing </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relax in Your Surroundings: Developing Situational Awareness</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am aware of seeing  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am aware of hearing.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am aware of smell. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am aware of touch.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am aware of the space beneath my feet and above my head </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do this as a warm-up. You can do each part for 30 seconds to a minute.   Or, instead of timing it, do each exercise for a lap or to the next stop sign or the next turn in the path. So use this 10 minute warm-up exercise to practice being relaxed in your mind, your breathing, and in your surroundings.   </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shake it up a little bit</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One day go for a run and breathe entirely through your nose and see how you feel. Another day do the same run but breath entirely through you mouth and notice how you feel</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try this meditation while seated, while doing a Calming Walk, or going for a Fun Run. No more being bored on your runs. No more slaving away to shave off a few more seconds off your 5K. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running with relaxed alertness puts you in a position of getting more out of your run by easing your breathing and taking in the details. You finally get to move through the world in a calmer fashion, not just once, but for the rest of your life, both as a runner and in your day to day life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run with relaxed alertness, </span><a href="https://pages.berni-k.com/chirunning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warm up with relaxed alertness using this free audio guide.</span></a>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: December 2020</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Matthew O'Connor</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-9335 alignleft" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/matthewoconnor.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="513" />
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was born and raised in Western New York.  I am a movement enthusiast!   I love to move.  My personal and professional life have revolved around my passion for movement.  I attended Ithaca College and earned a B.S. in Exercise Science/ Athletic Training.  I attended the University of New England and earned a Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree.  I currently live in Brunswick Maine with my wife, Abbey, my son, Thomas and my dog, Stewie.  I work as a physical therapist in an outpatient orthopedic setting.  My passion is to teach people about sustainable movement practices.  I love to see people get excited about movement.  My family and I enjoy outdoor activities in the beautiful state of Maine, including running.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest answer I can give is, you are who you are when you are born.  As soon as I figured out how to run as a child, I RAN.  Running was simply, who I was as a child.  I loved to run.  It was the most authentic expression of who I was.  I did not understand it at the time, but I loved the sensation of moving over the ground with ease.  I loved to test the components of running and feel the effects on speed and ease of running.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Distance running technique came into my life in grade school.  At that time, each student performed the Presidential Fitness Test.  One of the components was a 1-mile run.  At that time, all I really knew was, running fast, for short periods.   So when the start gun went off for the 1 mile run, I ran at the only speed I knew, FULL SPEED!  I ran as far as my feet would take me, then something strange happened, I couldn’t run anymore??  I had to walk.  I repeated this Run/ Walk cycle for the rest of the 1-mile test.  My overall time did not meet the passing standard for the Presidential Fitness Test.  Although I was discouraged, something special happened, I decided that I would figure out how to meet the passing time.  There was only one student who met the passing standard for the 1-mile run.  I remembered watching him during the run.  He had a completely different approach than I did.  He used a slow, consistent pace.  He had a more upright posture.  He used shorter steps and more limited arm-swing.  I spent the next few months running around my parents’ greenhouses trying to internalize this new strategy of running.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When I was tested again for the 1-mile run, I employed my new strategy.  I ran a 7:15 mile and passed the Presidential Fitness Test.  I remember my gym teacher shaking my hand after the run and simply saying, “that was an amazing change.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of the most valuable experiences of my life.  I learned how to set a goal and create a plan to achieve it.  I learned that your movement strategy can and should be different for different movement tasks.  I learned how the body can change with focused practice.  Most importantly, I learned to love the process of change!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My passion is and always has been, movement.  Running, was the movement that started it all.  The freedom of running and the exhilaration of covering ground in a controlled way, made running, my first passion.  I competed in track and field as well as cross country.  Running continued as my primary means of cardiovascular exercise, until several injuries, a surgery and chronic venous insufficiency, took away my ability to run.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Medically, I was told that my mobility has an expiration date, and nothing I do can alter that.  Like any good origin story, there is adversity, that adversity forces a choice, that choice determines the direction of the story.  I chose to go back to the beginning, back to running, and I would make every step count.  After years of focused efforts to regain running, I ended up in a ChiRunning Workshop.  During the workshop, I was able to feel efficient running technique again!  My wife said it best, “I drank the ChiRunning cool-aid and I was hooked”.  Since starting ChiRunning practice, I have been able to revitalize my running at 5k, 10k and ½ marathon distance.  As a father of a young son, ChiRunning, gave me hope that I will be able to keep up with him for years to come.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Movement originating from my Dantien!  Learning how to create forward motion with the forward position of my Dantien was a game changer for me.  This concept has allowed to me to decrease the stress on my legs while running.  It allows me to cover ground with greater ease and has cut down on my recovery time.  It has allowed my running to evolve into an enjoyable PRACTICE rather than just a mode of exercise.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Relax Into Speed!!!  ChiRunning gave me a much better appreciation for relaxation while running.  I love the sensation of changing speeds without a drastic change in effort level.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I think the biggest misconception of ChiRunning, is that ChiRunning, is not for everyone.  Although not every component of ChiRunning practice is appropriate for everyone.  ChiRunning is incredibly comprehensive.  There is a component of ChiRunning practice that can improve everyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 things motivate me to run:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">#1: I love the experience of running.  I love the feeling of moving efficiently over the ground.  I love the feeling when all my body parts work in harmony to create an efficient running gait.  I love the lessons of patients, persistence and consistency learned from running practice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">#2: My son, Thomas Jacob O’Connor, was born January 1<sup>st</sup> 2018.  I need to maintain my running practice to keep up with him.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am extremely proud of becoming a ChiRunning Instructor and the honor of Instructor of the month!  2020 has been a challenging year for everyone.  It means so much to me to help other people during this time as a ChiRunning Instructor.  Efficient movement can change your life!  I also greatly appreciate the honor of Instructor of the Month!  I can’t say enough about the exceptional character of everyone involved with ChiLiving.  I am inspired and refreshed to be associated with people who elevate each other.  Thank you all for the honor and I look forward to paying it forward as an instructor!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an instructor seemed like a perfect fit for me.  I am passionate about educating others on efficient/ sustainable walking and running technique.  I think there is incredible value in these two movements.  Humans are specifically designed to be upright and moving on 2 feet.  Walking and running are fundamental movements that we use for forward motion.  These two movements help us regulate ourselves and maintain overall health.  If one, or both patterns are lost, the options to stay healthy diminish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I think at some point we all ask the same question.  How do we sustain movement over a lifetime?  One thing I can say is, efficient movement is more sustainable than inefficient movement.  How you move, dictates how stress goes through your body.  Efficient movement affords less stress on your body and promotes sustainability.  Efficient walking and running technique can be learned through focused practice.  Becoming an instructor, improved my understanding of efficient walking and running technique.  It also improved my ability to help others learn sustainable walking and running techniques.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I also became an instructor to allow me to help others have a positive experience walking and running.  I think of movement, as a vital life experience.  Nothing lights me up more than developing enough skill in a movement, to feel it all come together in a graceful flow.  I want others to be able to experience walking and running in this way.  The sensation of efficient movement can be such a source of joy and I want everyone to have that experience in their life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that a coach can change your life.  I realized that if I want to become a better coach, I needed to find a great coach.  Becoming an instructor would allow me to learn from running legend, coaching legend, and ChiRunning founder, Danny Dreyer.  While becoming a ChiRunning instructor, I had the honor of learning from Danny Dreyer.  Danny is one of those rare coaches who will change your life with both his amazing character and wisdom.  I am forever grateful for Danny’s willingness to teach me.  He has made me a better runner, coach and person.  I hope to carry forward what I have learned and have a positive influence on peoples’ lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I feel extremely blessed to be an instructor.  It has provided me with an opportunity to pursue happiness.  I love to move and I truly want others to experience the joy of movement.  Seeing people light up during a workshop when they experience efficient movement is priceless.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Being an instructor allows me to focus my efforts.  People attending ChiRunning or ChiWalking workshops are actively looking for education on efficient/ sustainable movement practice.  This allows me to get right to work, doing what I am passionate about, educating others about efficient movement strategies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy being part of the ChiLiving Community.  I truly believe, when you surround yourself with good people, good things happen.  I am grateful to be surrounded with such a positive, passionate and caring group of people.  We all need support to grow, I feel that ChiLiving provides a great environment for my continued growth.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, most of my running happens when I play with my 2.5 y/o son.  I also try to build in 3 runs a week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To compliment ChiRunning I perform a regular strengthening program focused on posture line stabilization and single-leg strengthening.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that sustainable movement requires the ability to select an efficient movement strategy for a given task.  In order to maintain a sufficient amount of adaptability within my body, I use strategies to maintain a neutral/ adaptable posture.  I also make a conscious effort to keep a balanced movement profile in my life to avoid overspecialization.  Like anything in life, if you become more specialized, you also become less adaptable.   Forward walking and running are no exception.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I believe in a program that sets my body up for successful ChiRunning practice.  I want to go for a run free of restrictions that would prevent me from practicing efficient ChiRunning technique.  I also believe in a program that promotes adaptability of movement to avoid overspecialization of distance running.  This programming gives me the ability to run/ walk efficiently.  It also allows me to select an efficient movement strategy for other tasks I do in my life.  I believe that this is the best I can do to promote sustainable movement over my lifetime.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Relax…  Enjoy the process of change!</p>

<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My Father vs my Son.  I had the incredible blessing to witness by Father, in his 70s, race against my son, who was 1.5 years old.  My son at that time loved to line people up and race by saying, “Running”.  On one day in the Fall of 2019, my son gave the call, “Running”.  My Father and my Son lined up and underwent an epic race.  The course was over a mile of terrain.  My son took off, building an early, substantial lead.  My son routinely became distracted by the Fall leaves on the ground, squirrels running around and local flowers blooming that time of year.  This resulted in my father, through a very focused, steady pace, catching my son.  In a very close finish, my father won the race crossing the finish line with his steady focus and pace.  My son, crossed the finish line, asleep being carried by his father.  He was completely exhausted just yards from the finish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I love to run in the rain!!!  When I run in the rain, it is a standard format, a FUN RUN!  I just clear my mind and run.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DON’T PUSH!!!  Both in life and in running.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I simply love to run.  The “place” for me provides a different stimulus.  Each environment provides different feedback and opportunities to learn.  I love the experience of running in each environment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smoothie and egg sandwich.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Chips, Salsa, Guacamole!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My current goals are very focused:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Goal:  Feel better after a run than before a run.  Maintain a balanced movement profile to promote sustainable running practice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Goal:  Become the best coach I can be.  Continually improve my ability to coach others toward sustainable running/ walking practice.</p>

<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>Believe people could change, I would not coach.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I can’t run without… </strong>Logically, I would say my legs, but from a ChiRunning Practice standpoint, I have to say, my Armswing…  I find that arm swing is the most underappreciated component of running practice.  The more efficient and precise my arm swing, the better my run is!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>I currently wear a New Balance 870 for most of my runs.  It currently is the shoe that best compliments my running goals and current internal environment.  I am currently going through the experience of transitioning to minimalist shoes.  I am enjoying the experience of wearing the HFS Xero Shoes in small doses.  The HFS Xero shoe is a zero drop shoe that provides a great fit, feel, feedback and has passed the fashion test (my wife approves!)  I am still likely about a year away from a possible full transition to a zero drop shoe.  I am loving the experience of change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong>Personally, I love the experience of different situations/adversity while running.  I find value in struggle.  I consistently find that my most difficult runs are times when my personal expectations exceed my current capacity.  Running has a way of humbling me.  In Running and in Life, I am who I am today, and I have to be OK with that.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[February 2021 Instructor of the Month: Becky Croft]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: February 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Becky Croft</h2>
<img class="wp-image-9569 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Croft-278-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="774" height="513" />
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma. I don’t have much of a history with fitness from an early age, like a lot of people do. P.E. was more of a formality and never something I was super excited about when I was young.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being a Chi Running Instructor, I am also a certified RRCA running coach. I coach locally and virtually through an online platform.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I began running in 2012 with the Couch to 5K app. As a brand new runner, I thought I was going to die after running for 90 seconds straight.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I discovered Danny and ChiRunning on YouTube. I was searching for a way to adjust my foot strike from heel to mid foot. After practicing a few of the cues, I immediately found ease and efficiency in my stride which led to faster pacing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning has taught me how to run smarter, not harder.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That it takes a lot of work to adjust your form. Most people overthink the small changes initially.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Running is my happy place. I enjoy challenging myself but also slowing down to connect with nature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Running an entire half marathon in a crazy downpour without walking. Also, enduring an entire international marathon major in similar conditions. Running in the rain wasn’t always something I’d give into previously.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My mission is to redefine running for masters and menopausal athletes that wish to perform in their sport. I do this by teaching them efficiency and consistency in the programming I create for them. Most coaches do not address form or see it as an important piece of their athlete’s training. I know that my athletes and students benefit greatly from not having this area overlooked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That moment that my client’s eyes light up and they say “Oooooh I get it!” or “You ARE a good coach!” just because I’ve asked them a simple question to dig deeper into their limitations; this feeds my soul. I love sharing those little things with them so that they can enjoy running for the long-term.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I run at least 5 days per week and have 1-2 “quality” days, which include long run workouts. I also cross train a few days a week. My monthly mileage varies based on goal race training and I take a few weeks of planned rest once or twice a year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I incorporate yoga and strength training so that I reduce the risk of injury since I never really have an “off season”. This includes restorative yoga, weight lifting, non-impact cross training, and resistance training.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You didn’t develop inefficient form or overcompensation for issues overnight and new form changes will not happen that quickly either. Be patient with the process and take one cue per run to focus on. The changes will come! If you don’t think they will, try out your old form for a few minutes to feel the difference in your body.</p>

<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>The Berlin Marathon</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>40 degrees and no humidity!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> I’m currently focusing on relaxing my arm swing on easy runs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> New places! The lack of racing has challenged my local running routes so I don’t get bored while waiting on the return to races.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Peanut butter and banana sandwich and my daily vanilla latte.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race:</strong> Kansas City introduced me to amazing hamburgers with fried eggs on them. PERFECT after a hilly half!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> No 2021 races on the calendar yet but I’m keeping my eyes open while I keep working to become a stronger and faster runner.</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Mostly podcasts or audiobooks on easy days. A good upbeat Classic Rock channel for days when I need more “oomph”

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> Anything Beyonce or AC/DC
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>run, I'd be very unpleasant.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I can’t run without…</strong>my Garmin, even if I cover it up to hide my paces. Gotta have the data!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was…</span></strong><span class="s2">a local 5K</span><strong><span class="s1"> and I… </span></strong><span class="s2">wore yoga pants…and was beat by a tiny human </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>Brooks Ghost</p>

<h3><em>Katherine and Danny Dreyer to stay connected and support ChiRunning and ChiWalking in retirement as four Master ChiRunning Instructors acquire company and assume operations.</em></h3>
<strong>West Ossipee, NH (March 11, 2021)</strong>—Katherine and Danny Dreyer, co-founders of <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chiliving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiLiving</a>, which includes <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/chiwalking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiWalking</a> and <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiRunning</a>, have officially announced their retirement from the company. For more than two decades, Katherine, Danny and the ChiTeam have taught thousands of people the skills that bring joy to running and walking for a lifetime. Five Master ChiRunning Instructors from around the world have stepped up to assume the Operations and Executive Leadership roles to ensure transition while building upon what the Dreyers have established. In one transaction, Master Instructor Harrison Wong purchased all of Asia and in a separate transaction, Master Instructors Constanza Lisdero, Lisa Pozzoni, Sarah Richardson and Vince Vaccaro purchased the remaining areas of the globe.

Katherine Dreyer co-founded ChiLiving and co-authored ChiRunning, ChiWalking and ChiMarathon with her husband and business partner, Danny. For more than thirty years, Katherine successfully combined her healthy living with her career. Well-versed in T’ai Chi, Eastern philosophy, meditation and mindful practices, Katherine wrote, taught and spoke about all things related to health and wellness. In retirement she looks forward to continuing her work as a ChiLife Coach. Danny Dreyer, a leader in revolutionizing the running world for the last two decades, based his work on his 30-year practice of T’ai Chi and 45 years of running and racing. He has taught thousands of runners all over the globe how to embrace the principles of intelligent movement to bring energy efficiency and injury prevention to runners and walkers. He has also effectively trained hundreds of Instructors how to accurately teach the methodology of ChiRunning and ChiWalking to help share it with the world.

“We are excited to transition the company into the hands of four very dedicated and invested Master ChiRunning Instructors who wanted to keep the tradition going and formally purchased ChiLiving from us,” said Katherine Dreyer. “Their involvement will allow us to enter retirement with ease and grace while maintaining the integrity of the curriculum we have built.” Danny Dreyer added, “We first started CR because we cared about how people felt when running and walking and wanted to offer a way to do it safely and efficiently.”

The Asain arena was sold separately to Master Instructor <a href="https://chirunning-asia.com/en/portfolio-items/master-instructor-harrison-wong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison Wong</a>, of Hong Kong who assumed all roles across Asia. ChiRunning’s new <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/leadership-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive leadership team</a> in the remaining locations consists four Master ChiRunning Instructors, including <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/constanza-lisdero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constanza Lisdero</a> of Basel, Switzerland, Run With Constanza; <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/lisa-pozzoni/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Pozzoni</a> of Tempe, Arizona, The Running University; <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/sarah-richardson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Richardson</a> of Montpelier, Vermont, Rise And Shine Running; and <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/vince-vaccaro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vince Vaccaro</a> of Freedom, New Hampshire, Tri Tek Events. Combined, the team brings more than 40 years of ChiRunning/Chiwalking experience.

“We are excited about keeping the legacy of ChiRunning/ChiWalking going while having the opportunity to promote life-changing techniques along with a world-class brand,” said Lisdero. “The four of us are all taught by Katherine and Danny, and have been working diligently to learn the ropes of managing an international organization.” Richardson added, “We want to continue to help walkers and runners of all abilities experience the joy and ease we know is possible. In addition, we want to support all certified instructors and help make them successful.”

ChiRunning has helped thousands of runners improve their running form—reducing and preventing injuries, and decreasing recovery time. Runners of all ages and levels have improved their efficiency and performance, and experience effortless runs that are easier and more enjoyable. “ChiRunning lets people run as long as they want for as long as they live. It’s great we get to share this with runners,” said Vaccaro. “There is longevity in the ChiRunning process,” noted Pozzoni. “It’s so much more than just a training plan: it’s a life-long practice for safe and efficient running, as well as moving through life in an intentional and mindful way.”

<h3><b>A Journey of a Lifetime</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than two decades, Katherine, Danny and the ChiTeam have taught thousands of people the skills that bring joy to running and walking for a lifetime. The technique was born out of a love for walking and running and to provide a solution for the vast number of injuries people experience while engaging in the sports. Katherine and Danny’s dream was to make walking and running accessible, efficient, safe, and most of all, enjoyable for a lifetime. Their commitment to each other and the business shows in not only their accomplishments but also in the countless heartfelt thank-you letters they have received over the years from walkers, runners and instructors alike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine and Danny have co-authored multiple best selling books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiWalking, ChiRunning and ChiMarathon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They created training plans, workbooks, a ChiWalking and ChiRunning app, and an online cache of training videos compiled into the ChiRunning School. Most notably, they created a process for certifying hundreds of highly qualified instructors around the world to teach the techniques of ChiWalking and ChiRunning. And personally, they have taught thousands of walkers and runners to move their bodies using intelligent movement to bring energy efficiency and injury prevention to runners and walkers. This </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their legacy. </span>

		<content><![CDATA[<h2>ChiLiving Founders Continue to Support New Leadership</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine and Danny Dreyer, co-founders of ChiLiving, which includes ChiWalking and ChiRunning, recently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced their retirement from the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the past 20 years, Katherine and Danny have worked tirelessly to build the ChiWalking and ChiRunning brand. They entered retirement with an extensive resume of accomplishments. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine served as the business developer for the company and her strategies for publication, course creation, online content marketing and licensing allowed for global distribution of the technique. Danny, the creative thinker and Master of Intelligent Movement, shared effortlessly and taught the complex content in a way that was understandable to both runners and instructors. He traveled extensively to assure that new instructors were properly trained and maintaining the technique’s integrity. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These exact skills are the ones that the </span><a href="https://www.chirunning.com/leadership-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new executive leadership team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will continue to use and expand upon. Both Katherine and Danny have chosen to stay involved in a consultative role behind-the-scenes while moving away from the day-to-day operations and upkeep of the company.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Dreyer will use her well honed skills to develop ChiLiving and ChiLife Coaching, a passion she hasn’t been able to focus on until now. She looks forward to developing curriculum and training programs that focus on the creative process within personal and business growth. Katherine is delighted to have the time to immerse herself in all things related to health and wellness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Dreyer continues to train regularly, body sense consistently, and approach all activities with curiosity, seeking each and every “ah-ha” moment. He looks forward to building upon his vast knowledge of Intelligent Movement and applying the principles to other forms of activities including ChiHiking, ChiWalking with poles, ChiCooking, etc. He is pleased to continue working with the new leadership team and looks forward to teaching again in the near future. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine and Danny will always be the co-founders of a technique that has transformed thousands of lives. Their contribution will live on through their written works, programs and certified instructors all over the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">world. In case you missed it, you can </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/511939746/b0c0af5c87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch their retirement announcement.</a>

		<title><![CDATA[Learn ChiRunning & ChiWalking During the Pandemic]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>Learn ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking in COVID Times: Online Options</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With much of the world still shut down in terms of getting together in groups of people, it’s caused an interruption of sorts in teaching the ChiWalking and ChiRunning technique. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 10 months, the oncoming Leadership Team worked with Danny and Katherine to develop a content delivery strategy so walkers and runners alike can still learn the form techniques that aim to improve efficiency and keep them safe from injury. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny was 5 months into an Instructor Training when COVID hit and he had to transition to 100% online teaching. What he realized was that these instructor candidates learned and absorbed the material in a very deep and thorough way. We took that lead and developed our first virtual course for Runners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In November the first online program, ChiRunning Essentials Level I rolled out as a beta test. The 6 Week Course was a hit. With 80 Enrollees, the feedback was positive. The community discussion was robust and the weekly virtual instruction with ample Q &amp; A rounded out the experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what a few of them had to say about their online experience: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimonial 1: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimonial 2:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Testimonial 3:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few of the benefits for online learning include: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience: You can complete the modules whenever you have time. You can wear what you want, show up when you can, and work the lessons when they fit in during your day.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longevity: Because you have access to the course forever, you will be able to refer back to each of the lessons when you need them. You can watch them as many times as it takes to get the concept automated. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modalities: There are various ways to interact with the weekly lessons. You could read the content, watch the content on videos and be coached on the content during the virtual calls. No matter what your learning style is, the online course has you covered.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community: When enrolled in an online course, you get immediate access to the ChiRunning/ChiWalking online community. This group of over 900 people are sharing tips, tricks, stories, and encouragement with other on a continual basis. It’s been a great “gathering space” while races and group runs are on hiatus. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that learning in person is, and always will be the ideal, especially when you develop and ongoing relationship with an Instructor and get regular input and coaching on your form and focuses. But, we are excited to be able to continue offering high quality instruction during a challenging time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual Instructors are also equipped with tools to help you learn online. Zoom has been an extremely useful tool </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and allows an instructor to get a visual on your body and alignment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with the Video Analysis, your Instructor can get their eyes on your form regularly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for the Online ChiWalking Course that will begin at the end of April. If you’re interested in getting on the wait-list, click the link below. You’ll be the first to know the details and get a discount when you register! </span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[March 2021 Instructor of the Month: Hazel Wood]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: March 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Hazel Wood</h2>
<img class="wp-image-9773 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hazel-wood-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="519" />

&nbsp;
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m originally from Bradford in the north of England. I lived in France for one year and Switzerland for two years, but San Anselmo (just north of San Francisco), California has been my home for the last few decades.  I had a corporate career as a sales manager for a major software company, Autodesk, for many years.  There was a bike path by the office so I would go for a run at lunchtime and running and exercise became a passion. In addition to teaching ChiRunning and ChiWalking I have taught a fitness class for older adults for many years at my local Community Education department.  </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from playing field hockey and being on the athletics team at the Bradford Girls Grammar School I didn’t start running recreationally until I arrived in California.  It started as a bet with a friend –she said she could beat me in a race around the Marina Green in San Francisco.  I won and had so much fun I started training the next day.  Within a year I ran my first marathon. I was hooked.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Danny Dreyer through my running club, Tamalpa Runners, when he lived in San Rafael, California.  At the time my running was stuck on a plateau.  It was feeling like a lot of effort and my energy and enthusiasm for running had started to wane.  Also, I was tired of getting sidelined with Achilles tendonitis.  I took some private lessons from Danny in April and May 2002 and the rest is history.  To this day I can still hear Danny’s voice in my head “run tall, just fall, let your heels float up, relax your shoulders, use your arms, increase your cadence”.  It was a long list.  </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do I start?  First, by learning and practicing Chi Running I discovered it was the way I was running that was draining my energy (not hormonal change as I had suspected) and causing my injuries.  For me personally the biggest Chi nuggets or “ah ha” moments have been to (1) not solely rely on my legs but instead to move from my center (dantien); (2) focus on alignment and relaxation–who would have thought that running is easier when you’re relaxed! (3) use my arms efficiently–before Chi Running I didn’t think about my arms –I just took them along for the ride!  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was through Chi Running that I rediscovered my love of running ad felt revitalized and confident that I will be able to run for as long as my body will allow.  I credit Chi Running for helping me avoid over-use or misuse injuries all these years. It has given me a toolkit of focuses and body adjustments I can use to adapt to any situation—for cruising on easy runs, racing and avoiding injury as well as applying the principles to daily life.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That it’s a quick fix to running faster or avoiding injury.  Many people think they need to “do” certain things with their body, rather than listen to their body and just “allow” their body to move in subtle ways</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are several factors that motivate me.  While the “exercise high” doesn’t happen every day it does feels good to get out, to move and enjoy my surroundings.  The self awareness, self-development and sense of achievement feel wonderful.  I’m also motivated by the social aspects of the sport— the camaraderie of having wonderful conversations with friends, meeting new people, fun carpool outings to races and of course the post-race or post run celebrations.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To have been in the inaugural ChiRunning Instructors training with Danny in October 2003 and the fact that I am the only one of that group still teaching.  I am also extremely proud of having been a Master Instructor for several years and for having had the opportunity to help well countless runners improve their running or discover their joy and passion for running and their innate ability to run.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For running achievements, there are a few that come to mind.  In my first marathon, I placed 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in my age group with a 3:25 finish and eventually improved to run my best marathon time of 3:06 at the California International Marathon.  Way back in 2005 (after Chi Running for 3 years) I was first in my age group at the PAUSATF National Trail Championship at the Marin Headlands 50K. My other fond and proud achievement memory is when I won my third black shirt in the Dipsea (numbered black shirts go to the top 35 finishers in this handicapped race). </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the exact moment when I decided to become an instructor.  I had just finished one of my private lessons with Danny when he told me he planned to start an instructor program.  I could already feel the benefits of ChiRunning and wanted to share it with others so I immediately told him “count me in!”.  It was over a year before the program actually launched, but I was still hooked and committed.  </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love everything about being an instructor.  I enjoy being part of a fabulous group of like-minded instructors who are dedicated to helping each other as well as all our students.  I love to witness students’ reactions as they tune-in and learn from their own bodies and experience their “ah ha” moments.  I don’t just look at my students and classes as a teaching experience, but rather as an opportunity to create a fun experience in a learning environment.  People relax more when they are having fun and—as we all know— relaxation is a huge component of ChiRunning. Finally, I’ll throw modesty to the wind by admitting that I love to receive students’ positive feedback and expressions of appreciation.  Knowing that I have helped some part of their life puts a big smile on my face and makes me feel good.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there was a time I could easily run 6 or even 7 days a week I now need recovery time so I usually run 4 days a week now and perhaps an additional run/walk with my dog which of course involves lots of stops. My run courses include hills of varying effort at least two days a week and I enjoy long, easy runs.  I plan to train for a half-marathon as races come back so I will reduce the hills and do some tempo runs.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiWalking – with and without my dog.  I also do some yoga, pilates and strength training. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be patient, be committed to practice, practice, practice and be content with gradual progress.  Enjoy the process of listening to your body–be in the moment so that you can feel how change happens in the moment. Most runners’ stride length is too long so as a starting point I always advise my students to keep a short arm swing as they start their run to help them control their stride length.</span>
<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>The Boston Marathon</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderate temperature, sunny … hmm, that’s what I have most of the year in California.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cadence</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mt Tamalpais, Marin County</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Small coffee, a bit of yogurt and a few bites of an energy bar or some almond butter</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bagels with cream cheese, lox and capers, chocolate chip cookies </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dipsea.  If it is allowed to be held this year it will be my 39</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dipsea Race.  </span></p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Run without music so I can focus on my body and my running buddies or my surroundings.  I take my phone as a safety net.</span>
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… <span style="font-weight: 400;">I would be cranky and antsy</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I can’t run without…</strong>a<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> watch.  Not because I’m addicted to the data, but to be conscious of how long I’ve been out running</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was…<span style="font-weight: 400;">a cross country race on the Bradford Girls Grammar School team</span></span></strong><strong><span class="s1"> and I…</span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">threw up all over the games mistress’ car.  (A bit of trivia … a games mistress is a British term originating in the late 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century meaning a woman who teaches games and sports in a school.  We didn’t have coaches at my school.) </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inov-8 Rocklite (trail)</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was…<span style="font-weight: 400;">when I was running alone and over-estimated the length and difficulty of a training run in the middle of a hot day.  All stupid mistakes.  I called my husband to come and pick me up.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run…</span></strong><span class="s2">4<span style="font-weight: 400;">6 ultras – including one 50 miler, 10 marathons, over 20 half marathons, 38 Dipsea races and many 5Ks, 10Ks and cross country races.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. Where?</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A 50 mile race – the American River 50 in California.</span></span></span></p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking during a Pandemic: Online Options</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Written by: Master Instructor Sarah Richardson</strong></em></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With much of the world still shut down due to the pandemic, it’s caused ChiRunning and ChiWalking Instructors to get a bit creative! Since group gatherings are limited, we designed virtual/online courses to share the techniques. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The oncoming Leadership Team worked with Danny and Katherine to develop a content delivery strategy so walkers and runners alike can still learn the form techniques that aim to improve efficiency and keep them safe from injury. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny was 5 months into an Instructor Training when COVID hit and he had to transition to 100% online teaching. What he realized was that these instructor candidates learned and absorbed the material in a very deep and thorough way. We took that lead and developed the first virtual course for Runners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2020, the first online program, ChiRunning Essentials Level I rolled out as a beta test. The 6 Week Course was a hit. With 80 Enrollees, the feedback was positive. The community discussion was robust and the weekly virtual instruction with ample Q &amp; A rounded out the experience. </span>

<strong>Here’s what a few of them had to say about their online experience: </strong>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The instructors presented useful information. They are professional, patient and articulate. They were always available if further explanations or demonstrations were needed. They made sure everyone felt included. I believe their support, encouragement and advice created a welcoming environment." </span>~Loretta

"The daily worksheet worked well as it helped me plan my focuses and then consider if I was making progress with the form focuses. Also, being able to address questions to a certified instructor was a bonus." ~Randall

"I liked everything about this course! I liked that the focuses were broken down and given out once a week. Having just a few things to practice made it easier and gave my runs a new purpose." ~Sarah</blockquote>
<strong>A few of the benefits for online learning include: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience: You can complete the modules whenever you have time. You can wear what you want, show up when you can, and work the lessons when they fit in during your day.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longevity: Because you have access to the course forever, you will be able to refer back to each of the lessons when you need them. You can watch them as many times as it takes to get the concept automated. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modalities: There are various ways to interact with the weekly lessons. You could read the content, watch the content on videos and be coached on the content during the virtual calls. No matter what your learning style is, the online course has you covered.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community: When enrolled in an online course, you get immediate access to the ChiRunning/ChiWalking online community. This group of over 900 people continually share tips, tricks, stories, and encouragement with others. It’s been a great “gathering space” while races and group runs are on hiatus. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that learning in person is, and always will be the ideal, especially given the physical nature of the content. However, we are excited to be able to continue offering high-quality instruction and develop meaningful relationships with our fellow walkers and runners during a challenging time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual Instructors are also equipped with tools to help you learn online. Zoom has been an extremely useful tool </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and allows an instructor to get a visual on your body and alignment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with the Video Analysis, your Instructor can get their eyes on your form regularly. If </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for the Online ChiWalking Course that will begin at the end of April. If you’re interested in getting on the wait-list, click the link below. You’ll be the first to know the details and get a discount when you register! </span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Add Variety to Your Walking Routine]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Add Some Spice to Your Walking </strong></h1>
Do you ever find yourself bored with walking? Boredom can be detrimental to your walking practice and gnaw away at motivation.  If repetition and stagnancy keeps you from loving to walk, keep on reading. We have multiple solutions to keep your walks exciting, varied and healthy for your body and mind.
<h4>Drawbacks of Repetitive Walks:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Doing the same thing over and over can lead to boredom</li>
 	<li>You may feel less stimulated and engaged in your walk</li>
 	<li>You will not reap all of the benefits that walking can bring to your life. For example, if you are not mixing up your routine by adding in different distances, speeds and terrain, you risk only exercise a certain set of muscle groups.</li>
 	<li>Lack of motivation due to the drawbacks listed above</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Varying Your Walking Routine:</h4>
Varying your workouts is as sensible as varying your food intake. Just as your body craves nourishment from many different food groups, your upper and lower-body muscle groups need to be "fed" with exercise. If you always do the same walk there will be many parts of your body that will go unattended because they're not required to participate.
<ul>
 	<li>Mixing up your walks keeps your mind sharp</li>
 	<li>New locations and experiences decreases boredom and increase motivation</li>
 	<li>Walking at different speeds and for different distances require different cardiovascular workloads, which helps maintain a healthy heart</li>
 	<li>Varying terrain offers different muscle groups the opportunity to participate</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Spice Up Your Walking Routine:</h4>
Let's make your walking routine fun, versatile and well rounded. Here's a quick menu of walks you can rotate through to keep your mind and body stimulated:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Hilly Walks:</strong> Work your upper body and strengthen your heart</li>
 	<li><strong>Hiking Trails:</strong> Work your lateral muscles and improve your balance</li>
 	<li><strong>Focused/Meditative Walk:</strong> Focus on your breath, repeat a sound or watch a point on the horizon to teach your mind to relax by focusing on only one thing</li>
 	<li><strong>Energizing Walk:</strong> Inhale deeply for 3 steps, then exhale full for 3 steps to help circulate more Chi through your body</li>
 	<li><strong>Aerobic Walk:</strong> Distance walking at a consistent, comfortable pace builds aerobic capacity</li>
 	<li><strong>Fun Walk:</strong> Have fun exploring some new territory with a friend</li>
 	<li><strong>Group Walk:</strong> Build your social skills while getting fit</li>
 	<li><strong>Form Focus Walk:</strong> Take the time to work on improving your bio-mechanics by using the form focuses for proper alignment and relaxation</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Tips to Vary Your Walking: </strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Take a few from the list above and add them into your practice next week and see how they feel.</li>
 	<li>Brisk and hilly walks are great for conditioning and easy walks are great for recovery. Both types will satisfy you mentally and physically. Hopefully your walks will be more satisfying, motivating, and far from boring.</li>
 	<li>If you are new to mixing up your walking routine, remember to use the ChiWalking principle: Gradual Progress. That means you will start from where you are and gradually add in distance, speed, or new terrain while listening to your body.</li>
 	<li>Another rule of thumb would be to alternate your easy and hard walks so that your body has time to recover and build up stamina.</li>
</ul>
Adding a little "spice" to your weekly walking routine will work wonders on your walking appetite. You might discover some new favorite workouts. You'll have more to talk about and share with your friends. Your body will be better conditioned and boredom will become a thing of the past.

A detailed guide of how to do all of these walks can be found in the <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/chiwalking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiWalking book or Workbook.</a>

<h1 class="entry-title">Good Walking Technique: 3 Key Elements</h1>
</header>
<div class="page-content">

<em><strong>Walking is by far the most common and most accessible form of exercise available today.</strong></em> It's a misconception to think that just because we have two feet, we automatically walk in the way our bodies were designed. It is true that at one time we knew how to walk with excellent technique, but early on many of us lose that form, and our bodies become misaligned and imbalanced.

Considering the current upsurge in interest for walking, there is surprisingly very little instruction available on how to walk properly. In fact, many people who start a walking program do so with poor technique which may result in sore backs, hips, hamstrings, ankles and knees.

We are committed to helping people move properly and with the least amount of resistance. It's common for people to take golf lessons, skiing lessons, tennis lessons, etc. We want to make sure that we teach those looking to walk properly how to do so. <em><strong>By learning how to ChiWalk, you can regain your balance, improve your mobility and ultimately reclaim your health.</strong></em>

Here are 3 Key elements to Begin ChiWalking:
<h3> 1. Find Proper Alignment:</h3>
Proper alignment is the foundation for ChiWalking. The efficiency of your walking is directly proportional to the quality of your posture. In ChiWalking we begin by making a practice of maintaining proper posture, not just when walking, but in all activities. When standing still, correct posture means your shoulders, hips and ankles are aligned in a straight, vertical line. When our joints are stacked in this manner, we call this our column. You should feel tall and strong as you walk, with your skeletal system bearing your weight.
<h3>2. Create Balance:</h3>
Physical balance is essential for developing efficient walking technique. When you walk in balance, it takes less work to support your body weight and less effort to move forward. Think about evenly distributing your weight on each of your feet and keeping your center of mass over your feet. Having good balance also insures much less potential for falling. Practice walking in place by bending your knees and allowing your ankles to relax.
<h3>3. Move Using Your Core:</h3>
Core muscles stabilize your pelvis during movement. They are the strongest muscle group in your body. When engaged and used properly, your core also hold your spine erect and balanced, and help move your legs. It brings efficiency and ease to walking and other movements. If your core is weak, you will compensate by using your arms and legs to do the work. It becomes much harder and less efficient when you walk or perform other activities of daily living. Start by engaging your core to keep your pelvis stable. Then move your center of mass forward while bending your knees (as you did when you practiced walking in place) and allowing your ankles to relax.

<em><strong>ChiWalking brings efficiency and ease into any walking practice.</strong></em> These three steps will get you off to a good start and help you walk with excellent technique that not only feels good, but helps prevent walking injuries.

		<content><![CDATA[<h3>The Current Health Crisis</h3>
No one will argue the fact that we as a culture continue to face a health crisis. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), even with higher spending on health care, the US is producing worse health outcomes. Some of the facts from the <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20spends%20more%20on%20health%20care%20as%20a%20share,higher%20than%20the%20OECD%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonwealth Fund's 2020 article</a> include:
<ul>
 	<li>The U.S. spends more on health care as a share of the economy — nearly twice as much as the average OECD country — yet has the lowest life expectancy and highest suicide rates among the 11 nations. (<a class="authors__link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/person/roosa-tikkanen">Roosa Tikkanen</a>, <a class="authors__link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/person/melinda-k-abrams">Melinda K. Abrams</a>)</li>
 	<li>The U.S. has the highest chronic disease burden and an obesity rate that is two times higher than the OECD average. (<a class="authors__link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/person/roosa-tikkanen">Roosa Tikkanen</a>, <a class="authors__link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/person/melinda-k-abrams">Melinda K. Abrams</a>)</li>
</ul>
Lifestyle diseases continue to top the chart. Obesity is rampant, along with heart disease and diabetes. In response to this crises, walking has been studied and shown to be a great antidote to all of these.
<h3>Ways to Improve Overall Health</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Being overweight or obese is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke.</li>
 	<li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> 30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity five days a week. Brisk walking or a similar activity most days of the week can help with weight loss and lower blood pressure.</li>
 	<li><strong>Healthy Eating:</strong> Eat a variety of foods that include a rainbow of vegetables. Wait to eat until you are hungry and stop eating when you are satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How ChiWalking Can Help</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Keeps You Moving:</strong> The <em>best </em>solution is to learn to move well so you can continue moving more. ChiWalking, along with the mindfulness it promotes (in movement and lifestyle) is a simple solution to this deadly problem. Prevention goes a long, long way. While many health-related challenges may seem out of our control, <strong><em>exercising regularly is something we can completely control.</em> </strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Proper Form Keeps You Safe:</strong> The ChiWalking technique takes into consideration your form and how it interacts with gravity and the force of the oncoming road. ChiWalking teaches you how to <strong><em>move properly and efficiently so we can consistently walk without being sidelined by pain or injury.</em></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Make it a Mindful Practice: </strong>The ChiWalking practice is a form of mindful movement. <em><strong>W</strong><strong>orkouts become a time to learn more about our bodies.</strong> </em>For instance, when your core is engaged and your posture is aligned, you may find that your lower back pain disappears. When you clear your mind and focus on your movement, you may feel your shoulders naturally relax as stress dissipates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17701485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walking at a brisk pace</a> has been proven to help combat depression and naturally elevate our mood.</strong></em> When practicing ChiWalking, we get the additional benefits of connecting our mental and physical selves. Because the technique helps walkers feel better and find joy while walking, we are more apt to stick to our practice, explore different speeds and distances.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Get Started:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>For walkers: <a href="http://store.chiliving.com/ChiWalking-Products/ChiWalking-DVDs/ChiWalking-DVD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChiWalking DVD</a> – ChiWalking makes it easy to get in shape. Begin at your own pace and establish a lifelong fitness program.</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were on the webinar last week or listened to the replay, you know that aging gracefully is possible. We learned from 5 Master ChiWalking/ChiRunning Instructors about how using the Core Principles and Form Focuses of ChiRunning and ChiWalking help them redefine their practice as they age.  If you were not on the webinar and would like a copy of it, <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/free-webinar-chirunning-chiwalking-for-older-adults/?preview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>click here.</strong></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point, Master Instructor Ed Malley mentioned the need to “Fight Ageism.” While he was speaking in reference to a comment that was made to him while finishing a run, we want to share 5 tips that allow these Instructors (and many other individuals) to continue a robust fitness practice into their later years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>The best advice for aging gracefully is to engage in activities that promote physical and mental independence and maintain fitness levels.</strong> </em>The Instructors on the panel used ChiRunning and ChiWalking as a way to age with grace. <em><strong>Creating a Mindful Movement routine can be one of the most important tools for preserving vitality.</strong></em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the following as you age:</span>
<h3>1) Know Yourself: Set Reasonable Expectations.</h3>
Each of the presenters experienced a flow from higher mileage at faster paces to shorter distances at more moderate paces. It was inspiring to hear how they transitioned from ChiRunning/ChiWalking to include more cross training into their lives. They created a sustainable practice by setting expectations that were reasonable for their current conditions. They empowered themselves by doing things that felt good and brought them the results they were looking for: Sound fitness that was repeatable and enjoyable.

What they <em>did not</em> do was to force themselves to continue to meet their former goals and aspirations. <em><strong>They learned to accept their current conditions with positivity and possibility, rather than with judgment. They found ways to embrace their strengths</strong></em>. They found ways to keep a "<em>can do</em>" attitude!

Which leads us to the next tip...
<h3>2) Body Sense: Listen to Your Body and Let it Inform You on How Much, and How Far You Should Go.</h3>
The presenters each <em><strong>adopted a personalized practice based on mindful movement.</strong> </em>Body Sensing is a core principle for ChiRunning and ChiWalking. They each used to help inform their practice and keep it personalized. Here are a few tips for body sensing:
<ul>
 	<li>Open a dialogue between your mind and body by listening to sensations, both comfortable and uncomfortable.</li>
 	<li>Keep a curious mind to interpret the sensations. Repeat the comfortable and joyful sensations and problem solve for the uncomfortable sensations.</li>
 	<li>The faster you interpret discomfort, the more quickly you can problem solve, respond, and avoid an injury.</li>
 	<li>Let your body be your teacher.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3) Vary Your Practice: Diversity is the Spice of Life.</h3>
In addition to accommodating their ChiRunning/ChiWalking practices in terms of speed and distance, the presenters referred to modifying their programs to meet their current needs. Running is a very repetitive motion. <em><strong>Including other activities will keep your body limber and your mind engaged.</strong> </em>Some of the modifications to create a balanced, healthy, personalized program include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Include Rest/Recovery days.</strong> The biggest lesson learned from the presentation is that recovery time increases as we age. Build rest and recovery days into your program so that your hard work compounds rather than breaks down your body. Recovery is the key.</li>
 	<li><strong>Include strength training.</strong> All of the speakers engage in 2-3 light strength training sessions to maintain muscle mass and bone density.</li>
 	<li><strong>Include cross training.</strong> Biking, hiking, swimming are all complimentary activities to ChiRunning. Yoga or pilates also compliment ChiRunning and ChiWalking and do a wonderful joy maintaining strength, balance and coordination.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adopt a ChiRun/ChiWalk practice.</strong> Rather than strictly ChiRunning every day, you can mix it up with ChiWalking. You can also do ChiWalk/ChiRun intervals to keep your heart healthy.</li>
 	<li>Use poles if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4) Stay Inspired: Surround Yourself With Like-Minded People.</h3>
The presenters didn't mention it per se, but they are a part of an ever growing ChiRunning/ChiWalking community where inspiration is all around. They inspire others, and are inspired by those around them. By surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, they can stay motivated at all times. You can look for both online and in person options.
<h3>5) Seek Out Help: You Are Never Alone</h3>
When engaging in a new program to increase vitality a few things are necessary. First, check with your medical professional to make sure you are cleared to start. Once you've received the OK to get started, you can begin by <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading about the ChiRunning/ChiWalking techniques</a> or you can <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/find-an-instructor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a local instructor.</a> Many Certified Instructors now teach online as well and can support you virtually.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Aging is natural and a privilege,</strong></em> as there is no guarantee we will live into our Golden Years. The best we can do is set up the conditions to thrive as we age, as shown by the panel of ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The more we model strength and resilience as we age, together, we will redefine societal norms for the elderly. </span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[April 2021 Instructor of the Month: Laurel Flax]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: April 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Laurel Flax</h2>
<img class=" wp-image-10003 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/laurel-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="507" />
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born in Buffalo, NY, grew up in Washington, DC &amp; MD, went to college in NH and stayed there.  I live in a small town in Southern NH with my rescued Alaskan Malamute, B-Bear.  I have a BS in Animal Science with Pre-Vet Option &amp; a Minor in Microbiology, I also completed all coursework for an MS in Civil/Environmental Engineering.  I worked for Water Utilities for 6 Years and in Computer Tech for 16 Years. I have been a Lab Technician, Manager, Support Engineer, Sales Engineer, Technical Trainer and a QA Engineer.  I trained &amp; rode horses for Dressage and Eventing for most of my younger years and now train my dogs in Agility, Rally Obedience &amp; Freestyle.  I also play Guitar &amp; Ukulele - sometimes for others, but mostly for myself.  My father took me hiking on the Appalachian Trail when I was little, but I don’t think he had ever done that before - in college, I joined the Outing Club and did a lot of hiking &amp; rock climbing - I still like to hike when I get the chance with B-Bear!!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to run the Cross-Country courses I was going to ride my horse on and I ran some in grade school on the Field Hockey Team, but it was not until I graduated from College that I really started running - my boss &amp; a good friend &amp; I were all starting running at the same time - we would challenge each other to go ever farther - when we got up to 7 miles, we started doing 5K races which then led to 5 Mile, 10K &amp; ½ Marathons - I always liked to double the race distance in training - this had to stop when I got to Marathons (although I did do a 27 mile long run before my 1st Marathon) - I studied a little Tai Chi and I also did some short &amp; middle distance Triathlons - the bike was always the hard part for me - my first “race bike” was a Mountain Bike with slick tires &amp; Aero bars!!  Those were the days of being injured often, going home from races with ice packs on my knees and spending a lot of time in PT!!!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many injuries where I had to take months off, I was working on a slow comeback and happened to read the ChiRunning book - I thought it sounded  good, but I was not committed to learning it at that time.  A few years later, I saw that Vince Vaccaro was doing a workshop outside Boston and I signed up - it was fantastic and I saw all kinds of possibilities, but I had a lot going on in my life and did not take the time to really apply everything I had learned - a year later, I went for a run with Danny before the Boston Marathon Expo &amp; I went to a workshop with Danny &amp; Vince in Dedham, MA  and everything started to come together - my form improved and I was not getting hurt.  I was still afraid of being injured and did not really try to go very far.  In 2015  I went to  one of Danny’s workshops in Bethesda, MD - this time, I was reinforcing what I had learned and had been working on - I also met Betty Smith who is an 80 year old UltraRunner who has been ChRunning for many years - she inspired me and I started running &amp; doing Tai Chi with her - before I knew it, my “couple of miles” turned into a 50K and then 24-Hours, then 30-Hours - Betty would like me to go to Icarus in Florida with her to do 6-days!!!   I enrolled in  the ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructor Course with Danny Dreyer in 2019 and then took an additional ChiWalking Instructor Course with Katherine Dreyer. I can now run (&amp; run/walk) for 60+ miles without any injuries - my challenge for the longer stuff is sleep deprivation :-)</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was never really fast and I am 30+ years older than when I started running, but ChiRunning has made running an enjoyable practice that I plan to do for the rest of my life - I challenge myself more to distance than speed  and love to hear the feedback from my body as I run.  I love that I can easily keep going &amp; going &amp; going...</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of runners feel that they know how to run and therefore don’t need ChiRunning or could not improve by studying it and a lot of beginners are afraid to try it.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love the feeling of movement when all my body parts are working together in harmony and I love being outside on trails, just keepin’ on going!!!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am proud of the fact that I am doing Ultra’s easily without injuries and increasing distances every year.  I am proud of my Midnight Sun Marathon race that I ran a negative split on &amp; in the same time as my first Marathon 10 years earlier - finished top ½ of Women &amp; of Age group</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a buyout from my corporate tech job and created a small tech company but my heart wasn’t  in it.  I saw the opportunity to become a ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructor and thought that would be a GREAT thing to do that I would LOVE - I have done a lot of training of people &amp; animals over the years and I see people walking &amp; running all the time who could benefit from learning these skills . I see a real need for most people to move more - our world has become too sedentary and attached to screens - I want to be able to help people love to get out there and walk or run, feel good doing it and not get hurt</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love being able to share the technique and see the changes in how people are able to move when they go with gravity &amp; the road rather than against them and when they learn to relax and let it be easy!!! There is no greater payback than the smile when someone feels the difference.  I want to be able to walk &amp; run forever and I want to be able to share it with as many others as possible!!  ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking have changed my life for the better by giving me a practice that feels good &amp; engages my mind &amp; my body</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I run or at least run/walk every day because my dog needs exercise - I do longer runs once or twice a week and seldom work on speed -average weekly mileage is around 40-50 miles, more if I am getting ready for an Ultra - will often go out twice a day - one with Bear and one alone or even 3x -I also  became fat adapted so that I can do the long distances with minimal need for food on the run  -  it is important for me to be able to run at any time of the day or night.  When I am doing overnight &amp; multi-day races I need my body &amp; mind to think that 2 or 3 AM is a perfect time to go for a run :-)</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiWalking, bodyweight &amp; core exercises, hiking, swimming, deep water running, x-c skiing</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace Gradual Progress and take your time to practice - it’s all about doing some practice every day and enjoying the process - remember that you can practice anytime, not just when you are running!!!</span>
<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hamsterwheel - 24 or 30 Hour Ultra- Great People, good food, nice course and a good place to challenge myself not far from home</span></strong></p>
<strong>Most memorable race: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midnight Sun Marathon in Anchorage, AK - The only race I’ve done where the briefing includes what to do if you encounter a Bear or a Moose on the trail - the bus to the start had to stop for Moose playing in the road :-)</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: <span style="font-weight: 400;">50-60 degrees &amp; overcast</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on my wheels (lifting my ankles)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Trails in C &amp; O Canal Park in MD (after Pandemic is over)</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> 100 miler</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Without, although I did set up a boombox when I ran overnight Ultra’s in the backyard at night - 36 laps to the mile!! Public Radio, Bluegrass &amp; Folk music</span>
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… <span style="font-weight: 400;">I would probably still walk a lot.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was…</span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 5K in Exeter, NH a LONG time ago and I was happy just to finish!!</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Xero Mesa Trail or HFS.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was…</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Mt Washington Road Race “Only One Hill - 6288’“.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run…<span style="font-weight: 400;">8 Ultra Marathons, 7 Virtual Ultramarathons, 3 Marathons, and 100’s of shorter races</span></span></strong><span class="s2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p>

		<title><![CDATA[May 2021 Instructor of the Month: Shannon Smith]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: May 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Shannon Smith</h2>
<img class="wp-image-10036 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shannonchirunning.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="543" />
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By day I work in the tech industry and by morning, weekend, and evenings I follow my passion of helping people move through ChiRunning and ChiWalking. I am also a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) volunteer which is an advocate and voice for children in the foster care system.   I live in central Massachusetts with my husband, two boys in college, our dog and two cats.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of my health journey to lose 100 pounds, I started walking in place in front of the TV because that was all I could do.  I eventually worked up to walking outside and then running.  My son, when he was 13 years old, was my first running coach and he did my first race with me.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I read the ChiRunning book while I was recovering from two surgeries on my legs.  I started practicing ChiWalking when I could walk again and then went to my first ChiRunning workshop and I have been practicing ChiWalking and ChiRunning ever since.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since practicing ChiWalking and ChiRunning I no longer have hip pain, plantar fasciitis, or knee pain.  I can move!  I’ve learned how to breathe and relax.  And I’ve been able to bring this same joy of movement without pain to so many other people.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning is not a quick fix, it is a practice and the more you practice it the easier it becomes.  Trying to focus on everything at once will be frustrating so pick one or two things to focus on at a time. Over time you will start to feel a difference.  Give yourself grace and time.  Gradual progress will build mountains. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love how I feel after a run. I never regret going for a run.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to climb a rope and then being able to do it at the end of Spartan race, you know when you are really tired.  That might sound silly but it took me three years to learn to climb a rope and a boatload of persistence.  The first conditioning class I was in, everyone else could get up that stupid rope.  I was very overweight and I couldn’t even get a foot up the rope.  That rope was my nemesis.  Dear Rope, hear me roar!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching my health and weight loss journey, I had many people ask me for help.  I desperately wanted to help them however I felt that I didn’t know enough.  So I reached out to Danny Dryer to ask if I would be a good candidate for an instructor since I am not a lifetime runner, ultramarathoner, or health professional.  He welcomed me with open arms and I went down to Asheville, NC to get my instructor training with him.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping people learn to enjoy movement is my passion and being a ChiRunning and ChiWalking instructor makes it so easy and fun.  It brings joy to my heart when people who were about ready to give up on running tell me they can now run without pain, or when I hear I’ve inspired someone who thought they could never be a runner start running and even enjoy it.  ChiRunning is a continual practice for all of us, even instructors, and I learn more every day.  I too can now move without pain.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I run four days a week and average between 15-20 miles.  My runs include variations of an interval run, a hill run (my favorite now), sprints, and a long slow run. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I walk about 10-15 miles a week, swim, and strength train, but my favorite is biking.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to do everything at once.  Focus on one or two things at a time.  Your next time out, pick two different things to focus on. It is ok, preferable even, to stop during the middle of a run, reset, and start moving again.  Be patient with yourself but also be persistent!  </span>
<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first sprint triathlon.  I finished dead last but I finished.  It was my first run after having surgery on both of my legs.  It was both my hardest race and my best race.  Victory!</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloudy and about 50° F.  I also love running in a light rain.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankle lift and relaxing my shoulders</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Mass Rail Trails</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing - I don’t usually eat before a race.  I also don’t do very long races.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireball!</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With covid, I have not signed up for any races yet.  I’m looking forward to doing more triathlons next year.  For now, I am working on heart rate training.</span></p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Both!  I love running to music but I also love listening to the birds and the wind or just talking with friends out on a run. </span>

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> Danny Dreyer’s ChiSchool audio lessons.

		<title><![CDATA[June 2021 Instructor of the Month: Emer O'Brien]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: June 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Emer O'Brien</h2>
<img class="wp-image-10077 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FitnesswithEmer-086-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a running coach and Pilates instructor based in South Kilkenny, in the sunny South East of Ireland. Originally a Maths and French teacher, I took a career break from teaching while I stayed home with our three kids. I then took the plunge and put my teaching experience to good use to train as a fitness and Pilates Instructor rather than returning to the classroom. I was certified as a <a href="https://fitnesswithemer.ie/services/chi-running/">Chi Running technique coach </a>in 2017. During lockdown, I completed courses on the Functional Biomechanics of Running and Running Technique Coaching Level 1 and 2 with the Running School, London. I am currently in the final stages of training to be an Oxygen Advantage Advanced Instructor. I also set up my own website Fitnesswithemer.ie last year and started online running programs and Pilates classes to keep me busy while my local coaching, workshops, and classes were put on hold. Thankfully we are getting back to meeting up gradually this Summer..I can’t wait!!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my early teens, I ran with my local athletics club. My favorite distance was 800 meters. I loved cross country racing too. I have many memories of running through muck and grass in the lashing rain, elbowing my way through the field full of runners hoping not to get spiked in the process!! Back in those days, I ran many races barefoot too without giving it a second thought. Unfortunately, I stopped running in my late teens when I went to college in Cork. But luckily I came full circle back to running in my late thirties. My love of running came back with a BANG and I haven’t looked back since!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember reading about Chi Running in a few magazine and newspaper articles 15 years ago or so. I bought Danny’s book and just loved it! A couple of years later I went to one of Catherina McKiernan’s workshops with my athletic club about 10 years ago. I remember thinking ‘everyone should learn to run this way!’ The idea of being told to run relaxed just blew my mind..who knew eh!?! I came away from the workshop full of the joys of running. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think coming from an athletic club background the main focus is often on running hard and getting good times at any cost, pushing the body to the point of overtraining and recurring injury. I never considered you could run fast, aim for PBs AND be good to your body. ChiRunning has shown me that you CAN have it both ways..aim high AND learn to run efficiently and with ease. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think lots of runners believe they don’t need to make any changes to their running form, you know? How can you actually change the way you run..sure we are born to walk and to run? I truly believe absolutely every runner benefits from looking at their running technique. We all (including me) pick up bad habits over the years. As adults, we rarely run like we did as children (sad but true!!). Our posture changes, it can be affected by our jobs, our lifestyle, our health.. so many factors influence how we move as adults and then we expect to just run. We take swimming, golf, tennis lessons, we hire personal trainers to teach us proper technique in the gym, we get coached in team sports, horse riding etc? So if running is your sport it makes TOTAL sense you should learn how to run well. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My running buddies, my athletic club, my health, my age!! I turned 50 recently (YAY..new racing age-category!) and I am still motivated by goal races, goal times, goal distances and I have no plans on stopping now!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
I know it’s probably a bit of a cliche but I’ll say it anyway.. running a sub-4 hour marathon in 2019 in Dublin. In 2018 I ran it in 4:06 so I just couldn’t believe I did it... I still can’t!!

I am also so proud of all the runners I have coached to reach their goals over the last few years, especially that first 5k goalrun, it’s hard to beat being part of that achievement..what a buzz!!!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I noticed running and breathing techniques weren’t part of most running programs out there. It’s all about the plan, the race goal, the strength, and conditioning, nutrition, the fitness.. all very important of course, but the absolutely vital element of good running form wasn’t there for runners. I love to run, I love to teach and I wanted to learn how to teach good running form and show runners how to run well and how to reduce the risk of injury when following a running plan.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
I really enjoy the whole process of breaking down running technique, going from head to toe, the little details that can transform how you move. I love when I can see the progress in a client's movement and their reaction to this progress. Everyone is different so it never gets boring and I sometimes can’t believe I actually do this for a living.

I could talk about running all day long..seriously..so spare a thought for my family and non-running friends!! Lucky for them I do what I do so I have an outlet for my obsession! In this day and age, I don’t think many people can say they love their job but I can and I know how lucky I am to be able to say that!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
Ireland has essentially been in lockdown since March 2020 so I’ve had plenty of time to focus on my own running. I’ve been running four to five times per week lately, varying from 3 miles to 13 miles. I had to run solo in lockdown but I’m now back with my running buddies so that’s brilliant! We motivate each other to meet up and run together. Also of course I am back to coaching my 0-5k groups so I run then too, it’s just fantastic!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a Pilates instructor so I practice Pilates regularly. Pilates shares many of the Chi Running principles...posture, alignment, balance, power of the core so it’s a perfect combination. I also walk and I hope to get back swimming over the summer too.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradual progress..take one and only one focus at a time (cadence, posture, arm swing, mid foot landing and so on) Remind yourself to enjoy the process of learning to run with ease. Don’t get overwhelmed, remember you are in control at all times so breathe, relax and go easy on yourself..and SMILE!!! </span>
<h5>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>Dublin City Marathon 2019</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>Cool, crisp, blue skies!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Focus on rhythm and balance..arms, legs, breath in sync</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>The Kilkenny countryside</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Banana and toast</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race:</strong> Oooh definitely the selection of cakes afterward...I miss it so much since lockdown!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Virtual Waterford Viking half marathon.</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Without music usually, these days unless I want to work on my cadence and listen to a metronome or music to the beat of 170-180spm

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> Avicii
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>run I would drive my poor family and friends crazy!!</p>
<strong>I can't run without…</strong>my running sunglasses and lip balm
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in my adult life the Iniscarra 4 mile in Cork </span>and I…nearly collapsed as the course was so hilly!!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>Altra escalante racers and saucony type A9 racers</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong>my 2nd attempt at the Waterford AC half marathon, started out waaaaaay too fast following a pacer who was banking the time I think which didn’t suit me AT ALL. The final 3 miles were horrendous, it felt like running in treacle!!!!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… </span></strong><span class="s1">marathons/races. 4 marathons, at least 20 half marathons, can not count 10ks, 5miles, 4miles, 5ks!!!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. </strong>26.2 miles…. Where?  Dublin city marathon 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019!!! #runthistown</span></p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[July 2021 Instructor of the Month: Trent Corey]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: July 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Trent Corey</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10135 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I live in Vancouver, Washington, and am a Doctor of Physical Therapy.  </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to love baseball and basketball as a kid, then decided to go out for cross country for Dubuque Senior High School in Dubuque, IA.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was frustrated to see patients who I helped with their injuries keep getting hurt again.  I heard other physical therapists talk about ChiRunning, which led me to buy the book.  It made sense to me instantly, and I knew this was a huge missing piece to helping runners.  </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
I used to think that success in running ONLY had to do with pushing harder and harder.  There’s no doubt that it takes work, but it’s all in how you can focus your mind and body that determines how hard it will be.  I’ve learned to align and relax more and still run quite quickly, even after 40.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just lean forward” or looking at it from a purely mechanical point of view.  The mechanics will definitely improve, but it’s really more about your mind. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love getting into the flow state, whether it be through meditation, work, or running. Time just stands still, and I can enjoy the moment and accomplish great things.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
When I was in college, I ran 29:45 for 10,000 meters in track, but the training destroyed my body.  I also ran a 2:37 marathon, which is a satisfying accomplishment.  I’m also very happy with my progression as a human being on this planet, learning to let things go and be more present, enjoying time with family and friends and whatever comes my way.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
Physical therapy was awesome to help runners, but ChiRunning was the missing piece that taught runners more of the “X’s and O’s” of how running form can be made more efficient with less injury and impact with a mindful approach.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
Being an instructor allows me the opportunity to meet all sorts of people who I may never have met any other way.  I’m so grateful for that.  I love having the impact through my teaching to change how they view running from something that may hurt them to something that makes them stronger and healthier, just by changing a few things.  The trajectory of their improvement is entirely up to them, and I’ve seen some nice changes.

Being an instructor has let me have a lot of fun to talk about and teach a topic that I’m very passionate about.  It’s amazing how 4 hours of a class can go by so quickly because I’m having so much fun.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
Right now I’m doing about 15-20 miles per week, which fits nicely with my busy life with my family, coaching baseball, and starting my business coaching runners and seeing physical therapy clients. I do a couple 4-5 mile runs during the week, then get a longer run on the weekend, preferably on trails 
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
I do basic core strengthening on most days, and a special stretching program that I teach my clients.  I’ve also been doing more breath work, primarily the Wim Hof method.  It has boosted my energy level when I do it consecutively for several days to weeks.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GO easy on yourself!  Take the Beginner’s Mind attitude to the process, and just work on a single thing that you can focus on improving today.  You only need to take the first step, not jump the whole staircase at once!</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong></p>
When I won the Iowa state cross country meet in high school, and dedicated the race to my mother.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>40s to 50’s with a light drizzle.  We get a lot of that in the Pacific NW!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong>My ARMS! Weird huh? But it works to help get my legs in the right place without focusing on them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>Whipple Creek park near my home.<b> </b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Kion clean energy bars!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: </strong>What do you have around? Nothing like a juicy watermelon on a hot day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong>The Bix7 in Davenport, IA.  Would be very happy to run under 42 minutes, elated if under 40!</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Never with music. I’m not against it, just haven’t done it. I love podcasts and might help me on my longer solo runs.

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> I listen to a lot of inspirational audiobooks.  Most recently it’s been a lot of Wayne Dyer. His book <i>Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the Tao</i> is life changing.  You’re welcome!
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>have the struggles and frustrations in my life, then I wouldn’t have become the person I am today.</p>
<strong>I can't run without… </strong>doing some sort of mental and physical preparation first.  Even if it’s just a few seconds, I like to acknowledge how darn lucky I am to be able to run.
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… </span></strong>the Prairie Invitational in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and I …actually had a super kick because I was worried of going out too fast and dying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>my Altra Lone Peaks.  Put my Correct Toes and metatarsal pads in (thanks Dr. Ray McClanahan) and I’m good to go.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong>probably something in college…I’ve blocked it out of my mind, haha!  I remember 3 x 2 milers on the golf course at around 10:00 each, then lots of extra running that day that put us over 20 miles for the day.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… </span></strong>3 marathons: Chicago, Boston, and Arizona Rock and Roll. I’d like to run one again soon.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. </strong>is the marathon, above. I’m planning to do a 50K this September in the Columbia River Gorge, but it will likely be a glorified hike.</span></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: August 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Willem Mucher</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10178 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/45369950_2185276344858527_7187304251444428800_o-206x300.jpeg" alt="" width="206" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</strong></p>
I was born in the vintage year 1964 in the southern part of the Netherlands, at the border with Germany and close to Belgium as well. It is one of the few hilly parts in the Netherlands and I do like it here, especially since you can hop over the borders in a breeze and be in a different environment. I currently share most of my time between my home place and a small town close to Brussels, Belgium.

After finishing college and being drafted into the army as a medic, I studied Physics for just a year at Amsterdam University. Music was pulling me a lot harder. I lived in NY in 1986 for 2 years, where I went to study jazz piano at the New School of Contemporary Arts for 1 ½ years. 2 Years later I moved back to Amsterdam to continue my studies at the conservatory as a pianist and as a teacher.

The 90’s were great for me, with 200+ gigs per year and 60 piano students. I’ve been a musician and music teacher for about 30 years altogether. In 2002 I moved to Albertville in the French Alps, where I lived for 10 years. We started a music school in Albertville, the city of the Olympic winter games in 1992.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I've always been sportive in several disciplines and in Martial Arts most of my life. I started running "seriously" for the first time around 30 years ago. I am (have to think!) still 56 now.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started running with a local club in Albertville after a big house renovation project of 5 years. The club just started picking up trail running and I just loved combining running with discovering the beautiful neighborhood. Ultra trail running was also coming up and I started quickly doubling my distances every couple of months or so. GPS devices were rare and we still used a map. But many runners including me (ripped calf muscles) got regularly injured. Upon asking colleagues what to do about it, they said that injuries were just part of the deal. To me, that was no answer. I was a regular visitor of the website boingboing and found around 2009 an article about ChiRunning that stuck with me. There were hardly any videos available back then and I remained skeptical about Chirunning. So I bought a ChiRunning book copy 2nd hand. The book in the end totally convinced me, ChiRunning was the real deal for me! The fact that I had some T'ai Chi experience did help. But I could not convince my fellow runners of the runners club. My personal proof that ChiRunning works was in 2011 when I ran my first mountain races of 100+k. I did 2 of them within 2 weeks and I could just pick up regular training within 3 days! The 6 other club members that also registered for the 2 races had to abandon before or during the second race because of injuries. From that point on I was hooked.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
Once you are really connected with your Chi, you are totally connected and feel one with the present moment. Being in the present is what so many teachings teach you as the only way to be happy and free of fear and sorrow. My perception of time can completely disappear during a run and I can cover hundreds of kilometers. Doing a race in a forest against the clock seems more and more absurd to me from this point of view.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many runners are only concerned about performance and forget that mastery takes time, patience, and commitment. I quite often get perpetually injured performance runners who are out of options to be able to run and finally give ChiRunning a shot. As a consequence in my experience, many other non-injured performance runners think that ChiRunning is for slow runners only. Also the whole Chi and mind part behind ChiRunning is still quite unknown to a larger big public. I notice an unwritten rule with many runners that you have no right of speaking when you are a slower runner, which is absurd. I am planning a slow ladies or gents running club just for that.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The calmness in my mind and running with an inner smile. I always prefer to run in nature and even more on trails in forests.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>

<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">My Race Across Scotland (360km) finished in 2019 and my Legends 500km finished in 2021 in the midst of winter, both in one go. You definitely get to meet your own devils. Not sure though if I want to continue on this path of always longer, always further. I need 2 weeks of recovery afterward, which is too long for my current lifestyle.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Passing on the running fire to many people. Running will be a part of the rest of their lives</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">My yearly ultrarace through 3 countries that I organize each year in April <a href="http://www.helipad.tk">www.helipad.tk</a>. It has a wonderful atmosphere.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
It was a mixture of needing, wanting, and willing. My music practice slowly died, because time was causing change. However, it was the right time for ChiRunning and I loved it. I have always been a teacher. Teaching is a great way to deepen skills and knowledge for yourself and I love to work on an even base with people. ChiRunning gave me an opportunity to continue to work with the same character of people that would come to take music classes.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
I love to work for a long time with the same people, in order to deepen both our skills. ChiRunning is perfect for this, many students also became good friends. I recently started to call all people that ever have taken a class with me to ask them how they were doing and if ChiRunning still affects their life. By far most students still somehow apply ChiRunning.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
I run 4-5 times a week, with one interval training and at least one technical training for myself. The others are trainings with my students most of the time. As long as I am in this rhythm, I do not need to prepare specially for an ultra-race. It has been an average of 60-70km/week, but last December I did 3 crazy weeks of about 330km, for a challenge but also to check if my body would hold.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
I do some Yoga, Pilates, and TRX bases muscle and flexibility training. I love to walk as well. I need to constantly move and avoid sitting on my butt all day because I risk a totally blocked lower back if I don’t.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really, go for your own adventure! Just make sure to discover how ChiRunning has so much more depth to it, which is right there for you to explore.</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>Legends 500km</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>Does not matter, a grey sky just covers the sun!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong>just running again normally (lower back issue/lumbago from sitting too much on my butt lately working in front of a computer)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>Mountains and forests</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Nothing particular, eventually a pasta party</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: </strong>Beer! And my stomach is a black hole for the whole week after an ultrarace</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong>The Great Escape Ultrarace 160km in Luxemburg/Belgium in September</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> I never run with headphones, especially in nature. It bothers me not to hear my surroundings, my own breath, and the sound of my feet. But I just bought a pair of EarPods and I might try running with some ChiRunning School lessons.

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> I am an omnivorous: music, philosophy, religion, lame jokes.
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>run 10 years ago, I would have ended up with a burn-out</p>
<strong>I can't run without… </strong>my gadgets (GPS watch, Stryd, a bit embarrassed to say I feel naked otherwise…)
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… </span></strong>a 16km and I felt dead on arrival</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>Altra Escalante AND no shoe at all</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong>my first 70km, Le Templiers in France pouring rain and mud</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… </span></strong>500+ marathons/races.</p>
<span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. </strong></span>500km. Where?  Belgian Ardennes (dutch report on my website <a href="https://willemmucher.com/">willemmucher.com</a>)]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[5 Benefits of Attending a ChiRunning/ChiWalking Retreat]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h3>Benefits of Attending a ChiRunning/ChiWalking Retreat</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a change of scenery is all we really need. New destinations can break us out of our daily habits and allow us to truly focus on, and practice our running and walking. There are many benefits associated with attending retreats. This coming October, we are honored to announce that</span><a href="https://www.eomega.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Rhinebeck, NY, will host a 5 day</span><a href="https://www.eomega.org/workshops/chiwalking-chirunning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning/ChiWalking retreat.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Co-owners of ChiLiving, <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/sarah-richardson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Richardson</a> and <a href="https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/lisa-pozzoni/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Pozzoni</a> will co-facilitate event and bring their expertise to the retreat.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10260" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sarah-Lisa-Omega-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can expect to rediscover the joy of walking and running through efficient &amp; mindful movement. But there are many more reasons to experience a ChiRunning/ChiWalking retreat. Here are benefits of attending a ChiRunning/ChiWalking Retreat:</span>
<h4><b>1) Instruction on Technique: </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, at a ChiRunning and ChiWalking retreat, you'll be immersed in the form focuses. Learning the technique can be daunting if you're trying to do it alone. The book and digital teaching tools are a wonderful starting point. However, additional support may be necessary to fully embrace and implement the technique. Working with a Certified Instructor gives you guidance, direct feedback, and you'll leave with your personalized top three focuses to improve your form. When you tack on three or four days with an instructor you receive:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeated guidance,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct feedback,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embedded practice time, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversations about the technique with your fellow runners/walkers and Instructor(s),</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the learning grows exponentially. Your understanding will deepen. Your ability to "feel" your alignment will improve and leave you feeling confident in your movement. </span>
<h4><b>2) Focus on Mindset &amp; Mind/Body Connection:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many running retreats focus on logging miles, running races, and/or seeing new places. This is great for you explorers and jetsetters looking to check exciting things off of your bucket list. If you're learning to run or walk properly, want to improve your efficiency and prevent injuries, developing a mind/body connection is paramount. A</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning/ChiWalking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retreat provides the time and space for developing and deepening the relationship you have with yourself, your body, and your running. This holistic approach is anchored in self-exploration as you put the ChiRunning form focuses into practice.</span>
<h4><b>3) Explore New Places &amp; Meet New People:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting other members of the ChiRunning Community is an amazing experience. Runners and walkers in general tend to be kind, fun loving folks who are taking care of themselves through healthy movement. ChiRunners and ChiWalkers take it to the next level. They use the Chi Principles as a method of self-care that crosses into all areas of life. When adhering to the core principles, it becomes a way of life, ChiLiving. Sharing space with others for an extended period of time, as you do at a ChiRunning.ChiWalking retreat, makes it easy to pick up new tips and ideas for betting your life and improving your energy levels through efficiency and alignment. And the Omega campus... It's just gorgeous. It's centered in nature and leaves you feeling grounded and relaxed.</span>
<h4><b>4) Expand Your Limits:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of ChiRunning is connecting with yourself and improving your mind/body relationship, it also enables you to expand your limits. When moving more efficiently you may be able to run farther while feeling better. This is great if you're experiencing a rut in your running or walking practice. Attending an intentional, multi-day ChiRunning/ChiWalking event will give you the opportunity to dig deep for days. Anyone can show up and run for an hour, but at a multi-day retreat, you'll be immersed in the learning, connecting with others, and practicing your technique and growing as a ChiRunner or ChiWalker. Expand your joy, experience inner peace as you learn to optimize your technique and transform your exercise into a moving meditation.</span>
<h4><b>5) The Whole Package:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning and ChiWalking aren't just fitness activities. The movement principles and the meditative qualities that come from your mind/body connection create a lifestyle built upon alignment and relaxation. What better way can you think of to get healthy and stay healthy? ChiRunning and ChiWalking encompass so much more than distance, time and mileage. We teach how to create a lifestyle that supports your running and walking and leaves you feeling clear, open, and relaxed, not just when you're walking or running, but all day long.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[September 2021 Instructor of the Month: Henry Walker]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: September 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Henry Walker</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10291 " src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/henry.jpeg" alt="" width="381" height="511" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
My name is Henry Walker and I'm originally from the Midwest. Conceived in Texas and born in Indiana, I spent my formative years on the shores of Lake Michigan with the balance of my life in Texas. I'm a long time martial arts practitioner with my studies beginning at the young age of 10. I'm also a former Marine. My career has been spent building and managing high performing call centers and developing leadership teams based on trust and teamwork and I think this combination of skills is what has allowed me to be an effective ChiRunning Instructor!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most, I started running in school, 55/110m hurdles, the old 220, and the 440 relay.  After, I found myself in the United States Marine Corps whom I later learned, RUN EVERYWHERE!
</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)
</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boy meets girl online, girl likes to run, boy starts running, girl mentions half marathon and ChiRunning, boy and girl break up, boy takes ChiRunning class with Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni, the rest is history!
</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
It's all about being present!  Running for me is now more of a moving meditation where I'm able to unfurl my thoughts sans judgement, open to epiphanies!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think it's more about having a running instructor in general.  People are often surprised and want to know why you would need someone to teach you that think you do instinctively when frightened or on Black Friday!  I'm borrowing this but, if you want to learn golf you find a golf instructor.  If you want to learn yoga you find a yoga instructor.  Ergo... ;)</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a big question!  Health, wellness, the search for what I am capable of, finding my limits.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a single parent of twin girls?  Raising them to be strong, independent, and courageous.  As a runner and now instructor, knowing that there are a finite number of limitations, learning to remove those that are self-imposed, and helping others to discover the best in themselves...</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
As a martial artist, the "practice" of running made sense to me.  I was so thankful for the results I achieved, and more importantly, the support I received from Lisa Pozzoni, that I became a ChiWalking advertisement (see what I did there?) for ChiRunning!  It wasn't until Lisa asked if I had considered becoming an Instructor that I thought about it and realized it fell in line with my love of helping others.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
Another tough question!  Contributing to the wellness of my human family and celebrating in their successes is hard to describe.  With every interaction, you are making a memory for someone and you get to decide what kind of memory it will be.  It's an awesome responsibility that shouldn't be taken lightly and I dutifully carry its weight.  As a result, I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by amazing people that cheerfully share their energy!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
Finally, an easy one!  I run <span dir="ltr">Tuesday through Thursday</span> focused on speed work, fartleks, and hill training with Saturday and Sundays reserved for a long run followed by a slightly shorter run respectively.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
Resistance training is critical!  I live by the words of Georges Hebert, "Etre fort pour etre utile" or, "Be strong to be useful!"  Weight training to develop strong muscle chains, calisthenics to ensure functional strength, and mobility work to ensure, well, mobility!
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrace the Practice, Apply the Principles, Trancend Your Run!!!</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>2017 McDowell Mountain 50k</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>Low 50's with fog or a light mist!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong>Posture is key!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>Trails!  Any of them!  All of them!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Whatever my body requires;)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: </strong>The post-race energy of my peers!  (a Mexican Coke doesn't hurt either...)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong>The Ultra Tour of Edinburgh and The McDowell Mountain 50k!</p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> I generally don't run with music as I prefer to listen to the rhythm of my heart.  Body sensing is key!

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> I am an omnivorous: music, philosophy, religion, lame jokes.
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong>smile, remind me!</p>
<strong>I can't run without… </strong>freeing the spirit which untangles the mind!
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… </span></strong>the Veterans 5k and I...took 2min 38secs off my best time simply with ChiRunning!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong>Altra Torin for road and Altra Timp for trails!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong>in the middle of the summer training for the 50k where I Ubered off the mountain at mile 10!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… </span></strong>a race in Scotland! Alba gu brath!</p>
<span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. </strong></span>31.55 miles  Where?  McDowell Mountain Frenzy!<span class="im">

		<title><![CDATA[October 2021 Instructor of the Month: Michael Weintraub]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: October 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Michael Weintraub</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10349 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3CAB96D7-3483-4082-87B2-EDFD6550B9E5_1_201_a-213x300.jpeg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally from upstate NY, I have lived in Brookline (Boston area) for 40 years. I have been active in the real estate industry for most of that time working in property management and development. I have had my own real estate consulting practice for over 10 years. I have also chaired and served on several non-profit religious, real estate, condominium, and educational boards. Don’t tell anyone, but I am also a licensed, but non-practicing attorney.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It just came naturally to me at a very young age. I remember running home from grade school through the woods and roads and the feeling of freedom it gave me.  I started running competitively in 7th grade.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)
</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started thinking of competing in the 2020 Lake Placid Ironman to celebrate my 65th birthday, a race I completed 15 years earlier for my 50th birthday. I’ve had a series of overuse and impact type injuries every time I increased speed or distance that I needed to overcome to train properly. I don’t recall how I “found” ChiRunning, but I bought the book and DVD a few years ago, then attended one of Danny Dryer’s full-day classes. Very, very slowly I started to increase distance without injury giving me confidence that I could complete the marathon portion of the Ironman, which of course was canceled that year.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Success has been redefined for me to now mean running totally relaxed without pain or injury. Sure, I still enjoy the podium, but the liberating journey of joy and mindfulness along the way is what really makes it worthwhile.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure if it is so much of a misconception as simply a lack of knowledge of what it is. Many novices, and even experienced runners, never pay close attention to their technique - alignment, cadence, stride length, pelvic rotation, arm swing, etc. – nor their relaxation and mindfulness. Awareness and slight adjustments can make all the difference. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No motivation is needed.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it is in my DNA to run for the joy, freedom, and health of it. Since I started the practice, I have now become an avid ChiWalker in addition to my running. Walking is a whole new world to me. Who knew?</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you mean running achievements, I am proud of them all as we should all be. Certainly, I can count running my fastest mile, first-place finishes, qualifying marathon times, etc., as proud moments, but each race, each run, each workout brings a special smile. Lake Placid Ironman admittedly is up there as is becoming a Certified ChiRunning and ChiWallking Instructor.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of running injuries and never-ending trips to orthopedic doctors, physical therapists, and other practitioners (as well as the MRI’s and other tests that followed), I found ChiRunning®. I was always looking for “something” that would both fulfill my passion and enable me to “give back” at the same time. I vowed that if I were able to increase mileage and speed without injury, I would become an instructor – Mission Accomplished. Being a new instructor during this past year of uncertainty has provided challenges and opportunities. I’ve taken advantage of the opportunities by donating ½ day workshops to a few non-profit organizations during their fundraising events and offering a virtual 5-week ChiWalking workshop to another organization. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been passionate about running for most of my life. It wasn’t until I discovered ChiRunning that I was able to really appreciate running and walking as a complete holistic practice that could not only bring me to a higher level of mindfulness and fitness but to be able to share this gift with others. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
I r<span style="font-weight: 400;">arely run more than 3 days/week including long run, interval, and tempo. These are topped with 2-3 bike workouts; 2-3 swim workouts, and some strength training each week. Intensity and duration change seasonally.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a triathlete, I swim in a master’s program (proud long-standing member of the slowest swimmer club); bike, walk, strength train. I used to ski and golf and will probably return to the latter at some point.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning is a journey. Enjoy it. I tell my new students to practice one or two focuses at a time and when all else fails simply think alignment and relaxation.</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake Placid Ironman - misplaced my goggles before the opening swim, split open my plastic transition bags, left my race fuel at the hotel, had 3 flats and a broken spindle on the bike ride, and stomach cramps for most of the run - but managed to finish at the famous 1980 Olympic Oval with a smile. It was especially sweet as my wife and I was lucky enough to be spectators at that Olympics, 25 years earlier. </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>E<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">arly spring and early fall.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably relaxed ankle and foot strike, although each run is an adventure where different focuses can dominate at any time. </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Back roads of Brookline and through Boston’s Emerald Necklace</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> E<span style="font-weight: 400;">nergy bar, bagel.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever is on the finish line table</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake Placid 2022 (after 2020 and 2021 cancelations and deferrals, hopefully 3x a charm.)</span></strong></p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">No phone or music. If out on a short, slow run or walk sometimes radio talk show or podcast.</span>

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> Next question
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… <span style="font-weight: 400;">try, I would never know the value of failure or success.</span></strong></p>
<strong>I can't run without… <span style="font-weight: 400;">some body looseners, which definitely have changed over time.</span></strong>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… <span style="font-weight: 400;">back in Junior HS and I have absolutely no recollection of it.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Saucony Kinvara 12, although I am experimenting with the Altra Escalante and Rivera.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Marathon 2008; didn’t seem difficult until I crossed the finish line and was wheeled off into a medical tent with several liters of IV fluid, oxygen, uncontrollable spasms in both legs, and vitals that they would not tell me. Still made the plane that night to take our daughter to FL for college.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… <span style="font-weight: 400;">about 5 marathons and hundreds of races of all distances including triathlons</span></span></strong></p>
<span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve ran…. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Marathons in (FL, NY, MA)</span></strong></span><span class="im">

		<title><![CDATA[November 2021 Instructor of the Month: Phillip Young]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: November 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, Phillip Young</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10485 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Phil-Young-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a running coach, Oxygen Advantage Advanced breathing coach and recently qualified My Foot Function instructor. I’m based just outside Sunny Manchester out in the Hills in a beautiful village called Edgworth on the rolling West Pennine Moors that border the Lake District. I’m lucky I can step out of the house straight onto the famous Pennine Way or around the trails of Entwistle and Wayho Reservoirs which have some amazing forest trails that can be challenging.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I work full time during the day for a Finnish global packaging company as a European Business Excellence Manager. Evenings and Weekends are dedicated to my other business which I run with my partner Julie which is </span><a href="http://www.yourparinama.co.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.yourparinama.co.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Julie is a CHEK practitioner and is an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expert in the fields of corrective and high-performance exercise kinesiology, stress management and holistic health, so we joined forces as one of her specialism’s is runner’s corrective rehabilitation, so it was a no brainer to start to join the two together to offer an all-in-one package.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was certified as a Chi Running technique coach in 2018 and as an Oxygen Advantage Advanced instructor in early 2019. Onwards to recent years and I started my foot fetish as Julie calls it. My knowledge of all thing’s feet started with, anatomy of the foot, how the foot interacts up the kinetic chain. How windlass works and the effects of incorrect foot function can have on gait cycles. See you got me going there…. So cut a long story short I’m now a registered My foot function practitioner which has taken all told 18 months to complete and as I’m a glutton for punishment and personal development, I’m a third of the way through my certification as a Blackboard Pro coach with the guru of all thing’s feet Armin Hasser from Germany.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can honestly say, I can’t really remember, I use to love cross country at school but never really did anything about it at the time. I loved playing rugby and that was my running at the time, I’ve dipped in an out of running really up until probably 2010, Life just took over, Children, Work etc, then it’s really come around again but now it’s turned into a passion and a business.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)
</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weirdly from an injury unrelated to running, I was recovering from a climbing injury Julie bought me the book, I read it and when I was able to, started to put it into practice with small runs and the rest is history, 2017 I started my journey with ChiRunning certification, and the journey continues…</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><b>What's the biggest lesson you've learned so far from your running/walking journey?</b></strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Patience, nothing happens overnight, your body has to be ready to walk first then run, our bodies are masters of adaption, imagine you throw a pebble into a stream the water flows around the pebble.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same thing for the human body, if something doesn’t work the way it should, let’s say you have ankle restriction or poor hip extension, you still walk and run, your body just finds a way to work around the restriction, it is the master of Jenga!!!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Balance!!! Get good at balancing on one leg, just watch how much you’re running will improve, don’t do the normal balance exercises, be creative make it challenging for your body and your brain.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so similar to what I do and practice in Climbing &amp; Bouldering, your break a route down into small pieces, practice the moves and slot another piece of the puzzle together, one route may require balance and slight adjustments in where you put foot or hand pressure  So just like ChiRunning you break the whole into smaller pieces, practice and then piece another practice on, whether its breathing, posture, cadence, running up hills.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As with climbing, there is no perfect style, what may work for the road may need adjusting for trail or mountain, you just need to be mindful of not falling into the rabbit hole of perfection because it just doesn’t exist even the pros aren’t perfect. Everyone is an individual, none of us are alike, we were all born with the hardware to move, the software has just got a virus that needs to be removed and reset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many elements to running that I think sometimes we overanalyze everything into a one size fits all and you just can’t do that with human bodies.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe most runners think that they don’t need to do anything, and they have a perception that they are a good runner but define good. Bad habits can sneak in, Lifestyle’s change, sitting at a desk all day, sitting in the car commuting, slouching Infront of the tv. Just being aware of what your body is doing is an eye opener, there have been some amazing moments when we review people’s videos where they look in horror as they realize good actually needs some work!!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I have working with My Foot Function and Blackboard the importance of correct foot function is so important as what goes on at the foot has a dramatic influence on what goes on further up your body in your knees, pelvis, lower back etc.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my time to switch off I have a very pressurized job with multiple deadlines that need to be hit across Europe, So it is my meditation for the mind. if I’m out on my own I’ll settle into a run and switch off, it’s my passion, I love being in the mountains. I run more fluidly when I switch off into wind down mode as I call it. I’ve stood on the summits of some amazing mountains and seen some amazing sunsets and been completely alone which is perfect, relaxed in body and in mind.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to say training Julie to do her first ever 100k Ultra, let’s say when she crossed the finish line a few tears were shed, mainly from exhaustion but also the fact that she had beat her race demon and came in 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Female to cross the finish line and in barefoot trainers on rocky trails in 35 degree heat.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I would have to say The Bob Graham Round Recce this year, 36 hours to run 42 peaks in the Lake District with 8000 meters of ascent. To officially join the BG club you need to complete in less than 24 hours so it’s game on for 2022!!!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And last but not least I’m so proud of all the runners and walkers that I’ve had the pleasure to train. Whether it was reaching 5K, rehabilitation from injury or preparation for a race they all keep in touch with their achievements and goals for the future.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are thousands of online coaching programs but mainly geared to race preparation, It’s all about race goals, strength, conditioning, nutrition, all very important, but the vital element of good running form wasn’t very apparent or missing completely. The obsession with watches, trainers and what is a good time for 5k, 10k blah, blah blah….for me sent the wrong message. Something rang true with the back to basics of ChiRunning, my values and actually enjoying running for what it really is as a practice, rather than a timed slog of sheer willpower and pain no matter what the outcome.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoy the whole process of breaking down running technique to it’s very basic movements, the little details that can transform how you move within the gait cycle and what can go wrong and lead to injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I try to make everything fun, we don’t do fun in everyday life, it’s so dull and boring, so we bring games that have a tangible outcome into all the training we do, whether its balance, mobility, strength it has to be fun. Also developing new concepts that work in addition to the running aspects, Biomechanics, Gait has helped me no end in giving clients a more fulfilling experience to their own practices.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It really does depend on what time I get out from work during the working week, I try and get at least two runs in of 5 to 15k each and we get out at the weekend for a big one in the mountains of anything between 20 to 40k. If I’m training for an ultra, most weeknights will be doing either coached mobility work, conditioning and runs in between with big runs every 2 weeks. Weekends in the summer you won’t get hold of us as were out with clients on the trails or in the mountains.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My other outdoor love is rock climbing and bouldering, it does blend well with balance, strength and mobility required for running. I’m not a gym monkey, lifting a load of weights is not fun in my book, I get more out of bodyweight moves and when I do get the chance to get to the indoor walls, I do some calisthenics with my climbing crew that I’ve known for years who also ultra-runners are as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I do lots of walking as well as a form of cross training and we plan every walk and run with a traditional map and compass. Being out in the mountains is great but you need to know where you are and I never rely on phone and GPS as batteries don’t last forever and cell tower coverage in the mountains is scarce so old school is best. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradual progress is key, take one and only one focus at a time, Posture, arm swing, cadence  Don’t get overwhelmed and frustrated, you’re at the controls, breathe, relax and go easy on yourself, I’ve seen so many people starting out get so frustrated that it's not fitting together they end up back where they started.</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liverpool Rock and Roller Marathon time(3hrs:48mins), Live bands along the course, and it was the only road marathon I’ve ever done. I prefer the long haul races, pace becomes irrelevant and beating mind demons is the name of the game. What the human body can actually achieve is amazing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cool and bright.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry, not short answers!!!</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Uphill leg endurance is my weakness, so my Coach is working with me on some of the big mountain elevations, yes I have a coach too!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a mind thing I have it in my legs but my mind just says NO!! and no matter how many kites or balloons I put up my mind pulls them down, but I’m working on it…</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have two, can I have two?</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lake District – There are so many places to run and every time it’s a different experience, from skyline ridges to coastal classics and it’s on our doorstep. My current favorite is the Wasdale Head to Ska Fell Pike (Englands highest mountain) via the corridor route, big scrambles, very technical and you need a head for heights!!!! And the views are to die for.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Glencoe in Scotland, we go every year and run ourselves into the ground. Current favorite is Mamores' Ring of Steall ticks four Munro's (Scottish mountains over 3000 feet) it’s 10miles in distance but the total elevation is the killer 5167ft!!! yes, we are mad!</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Porridge and figs</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegan</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein shake topped off with a massive bag of crisps </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generally family size </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ha…. Covid put paid to races this year but next year is busy, we have 4 Ultras lined up two 50k races and two 100k races so far, but the ultimate goal next year will be completing the Bob Graham round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Lake District, it’s a lifelong ambition. We’ve done the recce in 36 hours this year 42 peaks, 8000 meters of ascent basically like running up Everest in 24hrs. It’s not really a race even though you are against the clock it's more about endurance and mental toughness, your legs will be screaming stop, your mind will be doing the same... There are less than </span><b>3000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people that have completed the course in 24 hours so it’s an even bigger challenge and I have twelve hours I need to knock off!!!!</span></p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without music, I’ll always take a metronome out with me, especially if I’m practicing something, I run a lot during the evening and in the summer you miss all those fantastic sounds that nature delivers, I rarely take my phone with me!!! But I always have a map and compass.</span>

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a massive Radio head fan – so it has to be Burn the Witch</span>
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">run in the mountains, I’d be sat in a corner blowing bubbles driving Julie up the wall.</span></p>
<strong>I can't run without… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Very bright head wraps and Sunglasses</span></strong>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we're talking official race then Manchester Half Marathon – hated every minute of it!!!! Have I told you I hate road running!!!</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vibram Five Finger V Trail 2.0  and Vivobarefoot trail. Socks are important too but let's not go there…</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved very gradually to running in minimalist footwear, people make the mistake of confusing zero drop with minimalist of near barefoot. It takes a lot of patience and knowing now what I know I would have taken even longer to transition down; I know now how the foot should work optimally which has made life in barefoot a happy experience and even better for clients.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">RatRace - </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man versus Mountain in North Wales, I learned so many lessons on that day, pacing, nutrition on the go, Run your own race, not someone else’s, don’t head off with the lead pack, mistake no.1 that I made chasing elites and suffering on the mountain climbs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… </span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 road marathon the only one (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have I told you I hate road running</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 half’s, 15 50k ultras, 8 100k Ultras 1 bob graham but not in 24hrs 2 DNF’s (did not finish) first through lack of preparation and the second heat exhaustion and plenty of 10k and 5k trails.</span>

<span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve run…. </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous has to be (BGR) Bob Graham round 70 miles 42 peaks, 8000 meters of assent - Lake District National Park – Great Britain, we added a few miles just for fun with a navigation error in the fog!!!</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[December 2021 Instructor of the Month: Jose Luis Sanchez]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: December 2021</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, <strong>Jose Luis Sanchez</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10597 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_4930-219x300.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Jose Luis Sanchez and I am Colombian, I live in Bogota and I am 40 years old. I am an industrial designer, carpenter, baker and coach of a wonderful team of runners in Bogota. I love camping and hiking in the mountains, I love flowers, eating and drinking coffee.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I did start running in 2013 after I had a rough time. It was a life-changing process that took me from not wanting to live to the point of wanting to help others. I met a beautiful girl and she taught me the basics of running and gave me my first 5k program from a running app. After my first 5k, I felt amazing and I wanted to go for more. Then we signed up for a 10k. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other 10k races came and then she convinced me to join a team of runners who were beginning to prepare for the 2015 Bogota Half Marathon, so I did. Then more half marathons came and I began to think about a full marathon… I did that too. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)
</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was enjoying running but found that after my workouts I ended up aching and had to take muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory drugs, I had to go several times to the orthopedist to have my pain checked.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I got bored with these training/pain routines, I wanted a change in my life because, despite enjoying running, I was demotivated by feeling that I was losing what I was gaining every time a new injury appeared and I had to stop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started researching different forms of training on the internet because I knew that there had to be a more efficient and less painful way to achieve the goal. I have surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci in both knees, which made it even more complicated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally found some videos and articles that talked about ChiRunning and the benefits that it brings to the people who practiced it, it sounded just like what I was looking for in my life, injury prevention and efficiency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In those days I was starting to run my running club so I thought it was a very good idea to do more research about it to be able to share this new technique with my students and at the same time improve my technique and make it easier.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered the ChiRunning website and found that they had seminars, books and a lot of information available so I took some time researching, I found that there was a certification course for instructors that was coming up so I decided to enroll without thinking twice. That really changed my life.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning has shown me a way to run with less effort and feeling like I can do it for long periods of time and for greater distances, being more efficient and consuming my energy much more intelligently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sensation of feeling that my body is floating slightly while my legs are relaxed and not even breath flows without much effort is unmatched</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me as a Colombian, Latino, it has always been difficult to follow instructions such as manuals and specific instructions. I have found some difficulties in the way of expressing the ideas of ChiRunning to the students because I feel that they perceive the instructions in a similar way to how I do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I have used different examples and other ways to make them understand the dynamics of the technique, based strictly on the exercises and teachings given by Danny.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What motivates you to run?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am motivated by how my body feels after each run, how my mind and body work as a single unit and take me to places that I had never imagined going.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, I am motivated by the fact of being able to inspire and motivate others to achieve their goals and find in this wonderful sport and technique the way to connect mind and body and be happy.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 New York City Marathons and counting. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to become an instructor to be able to teach others in the way of training that led me to be able to run without pain and be aware of my body by being able to build presence.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoy being a coach because it helps me to see in others the things that can be improved not only in them but also in myself. I consider my students to be my teachers all the time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My life has changed wonderfully since I became a coach, I feel that helping others change their life for the better makes mine change exponentially.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I run between 3 and 4 times a week depending on the goal I have for different races and sporting events.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I train with the running club on Wednesdays and Saturdays.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I bake bread on Tuesdays and Fridays at my bakery.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I transport myself by bicycle wherever I go.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I carry a lot of wood in my carpentry which helps me stay active and strong.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I ride a bike every day as a means of transportation and also on Saturdays I try to use the simulator at home.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I practice mindfulness meditations and some Tai Chi, twice a week I do some HIIT.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ChiRunning is a game-changer, what are you waiting for?</span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">12/12. Well, it's not a race, it's more like a 12-hour training on a 12km really hilly trail loop overnight.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> night, with a lot of rain, with a lot of mud, cold and hopefully with many hills.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Y-Chi and Arm swing</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>At 3200 m.a.s.l.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Avocado, kale, pineapple and banana smoothie with oats on top and of course a big pot of coffee</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamales</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: <span style="font-weight: 400;">my body and my mind are trying to put the idea to start looking for long distances ... 50k in January and then we will see.</span></strong></p>
<strong>Run with or without phone/music: <span style="font-weight: 400;">I never listen to music when I run, I feel that it distracts me too much and takes me out of my focus and my cadence, I think the best music for me when I run is the sound of my feet bouncing on the floor and the sound of my breathing.</span></strong>
<h5>Fill in the blank.</h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If I didn’t… <span style="font-weight: 400;">run in the morning, then I run in the afternoon</span></strong></p>
<strong>I can't run without… <span style="font-weight: 400;">socks</span></strong>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">My first race was… <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bogotá Nike 10k and I was really happy</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is… <span style="font-weight: 400;">HOKA Speed goat 4</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My most difficult run ever was… <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 21k trail race when I got lost and end up doing 36k</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I’ve run… <span style="font-weight: 400;">I´ve run 7 road marathons and 1 trail marathon</span></span></strong></p>
<span class="s1"><strong>The longest distance I’ve run…. <span style="font-weight: 400;">48k Ubaté, Colombia</span></strong></span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[February 2022 Instructor of the Month: Nick Constantine]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Month: February 2022</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, <strong>Nick Constantine</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10665 size-medium" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/twitter-header-2017-300x291.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am 56 years old and have been active in some form all my life playing many sports at many different levels.  Played golf extensively in the 80’s and my claim to some form of fame was I caddied and played with a professional golfer who qualified for the British Open. He was good, I was only OK</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After my first degree in Physics, I left to join the armed forces, was in for a few years, left and requalified with a postgraduate degree in Sport and Mathematics. After about 15 years in schools, I became a Vice Principle before I moved to working in Adult Education teaching Mathematics and Mathematical education. I am also a yoga student, have been for 25 years and study with the Mohan’s (</span><a href="http://www.svastha.net"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.svastha.net</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and I also teach sometimes. Developing a personal practice is number 1 for me. The yoga practice keeps me grounded. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was about 11, I would run in my old ‘flats’ to the tennis club, then run back home. Change up, then run over the hills to the golf club</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I would probably run and walk around 13 miles a day over the summer holidays. I officially started to run in events during my time in the armed forces. You get fit, but those combat runs with a full pack and running all night being chased by a pack of dogs is not quite the same as an athletic full gas hill run. I really enjoyed my first ‘proper’ event. </span>

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Very short story. I have an American family, they knew I was running and into yoga, my niece from NYC sent the Chi Running book in about 2006. I almost did not read it, but I was training extensively at the time and have an enquiring mind, so I read it and to be honest, the technique chapters were not as transformational as the first 4 chapters. Practice mind, the focus, the move to a holistic practice was the connection I needed to read about. Connected very well to my yoga practice of course.</span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a movement practice. The focus on an energy management system (Chi/Prana for yogi’s) and bringing some focus to your movement creates a frame for you to use outside of running. I always say to folks ‘does running make you a better person, and ‘how do you feel when you run. It should feel open, spacious, relaxed and you should feel at ease with yourself. As an old yoga teacher (Erich Schiffman) states ‘if you are fighting yourself you are pushing too hard, don’t fight yourself…..’ Look at Eliud Kipchoge, he milks his goats, drinks gallons of tea, practices yoga every day, and runs in a very focused and relaxed way. Keep it simple, running does not need to be a cluttered activity. </span>

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is all about technique, it is not. It is also about bringing awareness to you as a runner, a mover, changing your relationship with gravity. Becoming tuned into the physical and mental you. Developing a practice mind is the BIG message for me and my clients. Practice your running as you do anything else. Of course, technique allows you to sense feeling better and at ease with your movement then things happen! </span></strong>

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a practice, I enjoy feeling fluid, at ease, balanced and relaxed. It is like tuning your body in via your breath, The mind settles, in some senses, it is the yoga of running I enjoy. The feeling of running 3 miles, or 20 miles is the same to me. </span>

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, none. I don’t keep a hold of stuff like this ever not even in my other life. I am a forward mover and thinker ‘I don’t think about what I have done, but what needs to be done. The achievements I am proud of are the folks I teach. From ex Olympic runners to brand new runners first 5K it does not matter. What matters is they feel they can carry the practice with them until a ripe old age! </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time I signed up to refine my own knowledge, I could see Danny was coming over to Holland and thought ‘hey, great idea, why not….’ I thought to myself if I can help a few people over my time, that is good. I had no ambition to develop a big business but over time, particularly in Scotland workshops (before the Pandemic) used to fully book within weeks! </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps people a little, gives them a sense of what running can feel like. I have made some great friends and colleagues over time, particularly with the retreats I co-organize with my friend and yoga teacher. </span>

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is usually a mix of long-distance (13 miles), interval training, barefoot beach running, running in the mud and cross country with the usual daily practice of yoga and strength work. Usually around 35-40 miles a week(ish) The practice of mixing up distance, terrain and intensity is important in my opinion. </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga, strength work, cycling in Summer, lots of walking and generally choosing to walk rather than car! </span>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice, slow down to speed up. Be attentive the rewards are there but that is the hard choice to move from a Garmin orientated external sense of running(I like times by the way but not only a focus on time!) to an internally focused running mind. </span>
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an event called the Hedgehope Winter Wipeout. The title of the race was exactly what it was, 6miles up into the snow and ice and back down again. Mad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, I like going soft. So a wet, snowy winter’s day with loads of mud, hills and crisp sunshine. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very simple focus but very important for me is keeping those heels floating high away from the ground. As we get older and something I have observed in many runners, is the older we get the lower those legs descend towards the ground and we shuffle along. One great and easy mantra is‘ heels lift and drop under you’. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: <span style="font-weight: 400;">My local beach or the Scottish border fence around Northumberland. Lovely routes, not many folk run around the borders where I run, lots of sheep though.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Green smoothie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celery, spinach, green apple, pear, blueberries, orange, and woosh all gone. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dirty Beer</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe just maybe eye up some super senior vet races next year up in the high fells of Northumberland. </span></strong></p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[2021 Instructor of the Year: Cheryl Lloyd]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Instructor of the Year: 2021</b></h1>
<h2><img class="size-medium wp-image-10669 aligncenter" src="https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5969-213x300.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations, <strong>Cheryl Lloyd</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instruc</strong><strong>tor.</strong></p>
I’ve lived in Reno, Nevada for the last 25 years (near Lake Tahoe). I’m a native Californian who escaped! I’ve been a Registered Nurse currently licensed in California and Nevada since 1989. I have Bachelor's degrees in Exercise Physiology and Nursing as well as a Master's in Healthcare Administration.  I’ve been married to Dave since 2001. We don’t have any children, by choice, but we have lots of nieces and nephews. I still practice nursing occasionally, most recently doing COVID testing and vaccinations for our local County Health District. As a Master CRCW Instructor, I teach the online Instructor Certification Courses and teach privately. My days are spent running and mostly skiing in the winter. I love to cook (since COVID!), read murder mysteries, and watch epic skiing and climbing movies. I love the Yellowstone Series and yes, I’m an Outlander fan. Once I was a private pilot flying around in a little Cessna 172 out of Glenwood Springs, CO (near Aspen). I haven’t flown since 1996.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How did you start running? </strong></p>
I’ve been running since 6th grade. Running was a way to train for getting in shape for ski racing in college. Then I blew out my left ACL (knee) and racing days were over. I swam to recover from surgery, met Dave Scott (The Man), the Triathlon legend, and did two Ironmans in 1982 placing in the top 5 women and then the top 10 women. Running was not very fun but being young and strong, I got through the struggle of a marathon during the Ironman. Later in my 30’s, I did some road marathons with a best of 3:24, but really didn’t enjoy it. My first ultramarathon on the trail was a 50K in mud and rain. I was around 33 years old. I loved it! I started running trails and have been in love ever since.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life? (The short story)</strong>

My supervisor at work showed me the book and asked me to read it and teach it to her. I opened the ChiRunning book to a random page and Danny’s words just hit me in the perfectly right place. I bought the book, practiced the posture lesson, then applied directional alignment to my feet during a run. My knee pain disappeared (by then I’d had 3 knee surgeries), I got myself into a workshop and became an instructor a year later. A year after that I ran my first 50-mile trail race. I was 51 years old.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought running could be so comfortable, so joyful, so peaceful, so easy. Injury doesn’t happen to me (except for when I fall on the trails!) I’m running long distances that few women my age would even consider. ChiRunning transformed my life, not just my running. I’m passionate about running. There is nothing like it on the planet. Except maybe skiing deep, bottomless powder. </span>

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong>

I sometimes think people think it is only about mental changes. They don’t understand that it’s a technique that keeps them injury-free and makes it easier to run. Also, many people don’t realize until they take a workshop that they must practice. Changes don’t happen overnight!

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>

Knowing how good it makes me feel. Knowing that I can be out there alone on the trails just being peaceful and floating along effortlessly. Knowing there’s a Hazy Little Thing waiting for me at the end of a hot 20 miler!

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>

I’m proud to be a RN and the degrees I’ve earned in college. I’m proud to have learned how to fly and been a pilot. I’m proud to be a ChiRunning Master Instructor and now very proud to be an Instructor of the Year! I’m proud of the people who I’ve taught the Chi skills to and how it has made a difference in their lives.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong></p>
 I wanted to share it with other people. I wanted to be able to teach it to my friends. I wanted to understand it thoroughly so I could become a better runner.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?  </strong></p>
I love seeing how people “get” the CR skills. Their joy is such a gift. And to think I had something to do with that is something I will be forever grateful for. Being an instructor has given me access to learn from and run with Danny who is one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met in my life. In my opinion, he is a genius to have figured out how to teach people how to run so that every ability level and age can enjoy running forever.

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>

I run 40 to 60 miles per week depending on where I’m at in a cycle of recovery from rest, or building up to a race, or backpacking. That mileage goes down considerably during ski season. I run 90% on trails but will do short runs on pavement when appropriate.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong></p>
Resort skiing, backcountry skiing, water skiing and backpacking. Yoga, light strength workouts and stretching.
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong></p>
Practice! Be patient and allow yourself to enjoy the process of learning. Reach out to the Chi Community. Learn from an instructor. Use resources to support your lifelong journey such as the Chi App, ChiSchool, Chi classes, the metronome.
<h5><strong>Short answer! Okay, GO.</strong></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most memorable race: </strong>Tahoe Rim Trail 50 miles 2013.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideal weather for running: </strong>60 degrees, sunny, no wind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus that currently dominates your running: </strong>Lift from the crown of my head, ankles up, fall forward from my dantien.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Favorite place to run: </strong>Trails of Lake Tahoe region. Out my back door.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Eggs, cheese, avocado.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Celebratory food after a race: </strong>BEER!!!!!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Upcoming race/goal: </strong>Probably a 50K in the spring. Maybe Wild Wild West 50K in Lone Pine, CA.</p>
<b>Run with or without phone/music: </b>I love my music but I put it away for the first 6 months of learning CR until I had the basic skills fairly automatic in my body.

<b>Repeat on your playlist: </b>anything Led Zepplin Van Halen, or Rolling Stones, or Cold Play
<h5><b>Fill in the blank. </b></h5>
<b>If I didn’t...  </b>have ChiRunning I’m not sure what I’d do to stay sane!

<b>I can’t run... </b>without a bra. Used to be able to but can’t anymore.

<b>My first race was </b><b>…. </b>I don’t remember

<b>My current favorite shoe to run in is</b><b>… </b>Altra Timp

<b>My most difficult run ever was … </b>attempting a 100-mile race and completing 80 miles of it.

<b>I’ve run... </b>lots of ultras.

<b>The longest distance I’ve ran… </b>well if you can call finishing 80 miles of a 100 a run.]]></content>
