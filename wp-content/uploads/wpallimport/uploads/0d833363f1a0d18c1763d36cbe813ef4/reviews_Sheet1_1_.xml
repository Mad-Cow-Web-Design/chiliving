		<review2text><![CDATA["It was only around 2002/03 after a terribly painful experience in my first marathon that I finally let go of my attachments to "the old way" and started to Chi run full time. During the first 6 months of 2003 I finally felt like I "got it." It was a feeling I would get many times since. My next two marathons were more than 30 minutes better than the first and I didn't have the pain, through either training or after the race, that I had experienced the first time. For me ChiRunning instruction is a way to share what I have learned (and will learn in the course) with others. I am a firm believer..."

		<review2text><![CDATA["I'm 62 and hate to think that my running days are behind me, as slow as I am. So you can imagine my shock to discover that in this effortless gliding forward I had instantly dropped 4 minutes from my time for the mile. It is stunning to me. I really think the metronome forces you to fall into the correct form, because there is simply no time to get out of it.

		<review1text><![CDATA["Training with your beginner marathon program was great. The beginners guide was very insightful and packed with great detail, info, and recommended schedules. Two or three years ago, I was struggling to finish a 5k. The ChiRunning technique has made an amazing difference for me. We're now enjoying some time off from race-specific training, but would really miss our 3-runs-a-week if we didn't get them in. We're not expecting to break any course records but it feels great to be fit and it's a great feeling to now have the confidence to be able to complete just about any race."

		<review2text><![CDATA["I started running only 2 years ago and decided to train for a marathon that first year. Since using the method I have not had any other injuries and my running technique and speed has improved dramatically. Without the ChiRunning method I'm sure I would never have got anywhere or felt as comfortable running as I do now. I'm still learning and look forward to what I can achieve in the future due to following these teachings!"

In January, I recorded my highest running mileage ever. Last week I ran a 5k and took almost 2 minutes off the 5K I ran 3 weeks earlier. Each week I feel stronger than the week before.  Running feels better every day. Training for the half marathon has meant even more hours practicing something that I love. And, I'm getting better at it while remaining injury-free." ]]></review1text>

I can really say that ChiRunning feels very natural and smooth. So thanks for your support, and for spreading the idea of ChiRunning, which has been my first injury-free running experience (I have quit running several times because of injuries before…)"

I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't try it! Six weeks later--the day of the half marathon--standing at the start line, I was in my Chi!  Form right...Check...Attitude right... Check! On my legs, we wrote "run like a kid again," which is my new life motto."

Towards mile 5 or so I looked at my watch and was surprised to see Joy was way ahead of her usual training times. I didn't say anything to her because I wanted to see if she could maintain her form in that last mile as she generally gets a little tired. She came in around 10 minutes in front of her best 10k time ever!! Imagine her surprise as she really felt she was not running faster, just more focused and relaxed!!"
