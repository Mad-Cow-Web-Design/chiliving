The Chi Running Essentials workshop includes several hours of instruction in a single 1/2 day course.

We will spend time alternating between demonstrations, fun exercises and technique drills ... the nature of the day will be relaxed, full and inspiring.

Marc is an amazing teacher and has taught me how to run injury free!!  This was not easy since I was a true heel striker which caused me to have four tibial stress fractures in three years while trying to train for the marathon.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">After my fourth stress fracture where my doctors ruled out causes due to bone density or vitamin D levels since all the test showed great results, the consensus was that I needed to relearn how to run!!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Research led me to ChiRunning and most importantly, Marc Waxman!  At my first ChiRunning workshop I was amazed at Marc’s ability to teach.  I was not surprised to learn he had a teaching background.  Marc has helped me to learn how to run effectively and efficiently through guided runs and having me think about “form focuses” which he includes in my online training plan.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This past week I got a chance to use my training in the Providence Marathon.  I came away injury free with a PR!  A win win for me thanks to Marc and all his guidance.  My goal is to Boston Qualify and although I did not achieve that on this attempt, I am confident that Marc will get me there!  “I can and I will” is my motto but in reality I couldn’t come close without Marc!<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am looking forward to beginning another training cycle of guided runs with Marc along with ChiRunning “form focuses” on the Final Surge training plan.  I know I’ll enjoy the challenge and like implementing and practicing the ChiRunning form on my runs.  I truly believe Marc is the reason I am now finally able to run injury free.  His ability to teach the ChiRunning technique along with smart coaching is crucial to my success as a runner.</p>

I was so excited to find ChiRunning. Getting back into running as an adult was a little scary and I didn't know if I was doing it quite right. I did not have the time for pain, injuries or being out of commission, yet wanted to get back into shape... safely.  Sarah has helped me nail my form before injuries could crop up and I haven't looked back. She taught how to move my body with proper form and how to listen to my body.  I'm so glad that I can run with my friends and have been able to safely compete in races I never thought I could do!   ~Andrea",,,"<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Check. Check.</span></strong>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Being a busy working mom, I wanted an activity I could do on the fly and I chose running. But I hadn't ever been a runner before. ChiRunning was the perfect place to start. Sarah helped me stay safe and sound while I trained for my first race ever, which was a half-marathon! As a teacher, she was extremely patient and made it so understandable and I could actually FEEL if I was doing it right or wrong. I'm so glad that I took the time to learn my form, it made all the the difference in the world.   ~Maureen</span>",,,,,,,publish,164,sarah@riseandshine.run,sarah@riseandshine.run,,
