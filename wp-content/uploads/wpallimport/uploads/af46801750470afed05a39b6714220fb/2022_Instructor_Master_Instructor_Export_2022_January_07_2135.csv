Danny Dreyer is the founder of ChiRunning and ChiWalking which are based on the inner principles of T'ai Chi. Danny and his wife Katherine have been pioneers in teaching runners and walkers how to turn their fitness regimen into a mindful practice. Together they have co-authored three seminal books on mindful movement: <em>ChiRunning, ChiWalking and ChiMarathon</em>, all published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

Danny is also a lecturer and a leader in promoting injury prevention and higher performance through improving one's running or walking technique. His work is based on his 20-year study of T'ai Chi and his 45 years of running and racing every distance from a 5K to 100 miles, including 43 ultra marathons (with podium finishes in his age group in all but three). He has helped countless runners from beginners to elites set new PR's in both time and distance… without getting injured in the process. He has also been a featured speaker at most of the major U.S. marathons.

<em>ChiRunning</em> is now published in 12 languages and taught in 23 countries by over 200 certified instructors.

His all-time favorite pair of shoes are the <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/go/chi-run"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">XeroShoes TerraFlex trail shoes</a>.

Amazingly, or to be more precise, coincidently as my professional running career was ending, a new equally satisfying career was about to begin. I got my hands on a copy of Danny Dreyer’s book about ChiRunning. I couldn’t leave it down. After enduring years of pain and injury and wondering what was the cause of it all, Danny's book was providing me with all the answers. All I could do was laugh as I read what I should have known ten or twelve years previously. I would not swap my successes as a professional athlete for anything and whatever I was doing during those years, it worked. But I will never stop wondering what might have been had I known about ChiRunning from the start.

After reading Danny's book, I decided that I needed to meet this man. Within months, I was qualified as a ChiRunning instructor. It was a gift from heaven for I had no real plans post retirement. Yet now here I was with the perfect transitional job, teaching other people how to run effortless and injury free.

Thanks to Danny Dreyer, he has given countless numbers of people all over the world the opportunity to release themselves of the fear of injury so that they can enjoy what is so important to them, the ability to get out into the open air and do what is so natural and pacifying, to nourish mind and body. What more could we ask for.

– Catherina McKiernan",David P. ,2327,"About three weeks ago I had a very strong memory of what it felt like to run when I was a seven-year-old. The freedom, the exhilaration, the laughter. What happened in the intervening 41 years? Well last weekend I found out how to run like a kid again, all thanks to Danny. I worked with my body, I worked with the road and it felt great.

This is the beginning of a long and daily journey back to running for me, but Danny has made it possible and pain free.

Do yourself a favour and spend some time with this genius communicator. You never know, he may even change <em>your</em> life.

– David P.",,,,,,,,,,_,,,"I truly am glad I did the Workshop and Private Lesson with Danny.  There’s nothing like one-on-one to get to the heart of things, to get answers, to get such great feedback about my form (Had NO IDEA about my arms/shoulders!!!!), and to feel even more connected to this ChiRunning thing.  I’m very grateful that you started this and that you came to Portland! It’s really nice to know, too, that you are as genuine as you come across in your books.  ?

I am in love with the whole Chi thing as I am now taking Tai Chi, too.  I am an ex-swim coach and have used this philosophy even before knowing anything about Chi.  I have always told my athletes it is all about technique.  Guess you could call it “Chi Swimming”.  Anyway, thank you for your expertise.

I’m so grateful that you were able to discover this more natural and centered way to run, and generously share it with others. The (shared) private session was also incredibly valuable to me as “preventative medicine”, which will allow me to avoid future pain and injury by running with proper alignment and form. I really appreciate all your wisdom, humor and good energy, and can’t thank you enough. Now I look forward to hearing what you have to say about ChiLiving!

<em>Special Note:  </em>I plan on holding some workshops in 2021 - with small groups, socially distanced  and complying with all local health regulations.  I am also available for private sessions in Marin.  Please contact me directly at <a href=""mailto:hazel@stridebystride.com"">hazel@stridebystride.com</a> to see what is available.

Hazel Wood discovered ChiRunning in 2002. She was lucky. Very lucky. At the time, Danny Dreyer, the founder of ChiRunning, happened to live in San Rafael, California, only 5 miles from Hazel so she was able to take a series private lessons with Danny on both the track and on the trails of Marin county. Although she had already been running for over 25 years and thought she knew how to run, she immediately discovered that what she didn’t know was how to run efficiently. Like so many runners she was wasting energy and tight as a knot. She tells her students “the key thing I had to learn was to ‘effort’ less and relax more. Part of that meant learning a new set of running skills. Once my body made the adjustments, I stopped overusing my legs, recovered quickly and didn’t get injured.”

Hazel credits ChiRunning with rekindling her love affair with running.  Revitalized, she jumped on the opportunity to attend the first Certified Instructor Training Program in 2003 and went on to deepen her knowledge and experience assisting Danny with classes and working with participants in Danny’s marathon training program in San Francisco.
She is a Master Instructor and is proud to have been teaching for 15 years through her company <a href=""http://stridebystride.com/"">Stride By Stride</a>.

In addition to teaching both ChiRunning and Chi Walking group workshops and giving private instruction to individuals, Hazel has consistently been invited to teach groups such as Running and Triathlon Clubs, Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training (TNT), Team Survivor, Team Challenge, as well as in corporate venues such as Kaiser Permanente, the California Department of Pubic Health, Autodesk, Athleta, and more.

In her own program, Hazel is equally at home on roads and on trails and has raced in all distances from 5K to 50 miles. A consistent finisher in the top 5 of her age group, Hazel also has a number of 1st and 2nd place age group awards and has won three coveted black shirts by finishing in the top 35 of the famed Dipsea Race.

Hazel’s mission is to help runners of all abilities enjoy lifelong running (her oldest client is 83 and still running strong) with ease, energy and without pain. Her focus is to combine her knowledge and experience with her positive and patient attitude to create a comfortable environment whether you are a beginner or seasoned athlete.

Hazel’s company, Stride By Stride, gives clients the ability to choose from several programs, including group workshops, private instruction, as well as review and trail sessions, online coaching and video analysis. Visit her website at www.stridebystride.com for details.

Contact Hazel with questions or to bring ChiRunning or Chi Walking to your group or community. She is available throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area and can travel to other locations.

<i>Thanks for the great workshop. I have been an endurance athlete for 38 years - running swimming biking, and never has any one day resulted in so much improvement. And running feels so much more natural and fun. I can't wait to practice and bring the new me to races.</i> Rob M.

<i>I’ve tried running off and on throughout my life and I could never seem to find that “zone” that serious runners refer to. After taking the ChiRunning classes, I quickly realized my inability to find that “zone” was primarily due to the “way” I was running. By the end of the classes, I was running up and down hills with more ease than I ever imagined, and I was on a “high”.</i> Patti L

<i>Having returned to running this year, I experienced some left hip bursitis for the first time in my life. I took a Chi running workshop with Hazel Wood and following it I have had ZERO problems or pain in my hip! I discovered that I was imparting torque to my left hip when my arms were crossing the mid line. Focusing on pulling my arms straight back has made all the difference. Using the metronome helped immensely too.</i> Karen Reynolds, Balance Restored Acupuncture, Mill Valley.

<i>I did a sprint plus triathlon yesterday and I have to tell you … I used the basic principles you taught us and it helped me so much. I worked so hard on the bike I didn't know what I'd have left for the run, however I kept thinking in my mind to let gravity do the work, took shorter strides, and alternated between the different focuses. I honestly felt like the run was effortless. I was able to blast past two women in my age group in the last 3/4 of a mile and they couldn't touch me. What a great feeling that was!. Thank you! </i> Melissa Lewis, Triathlon Coach.

I’ve been running since I was 12, first competitively and then for many years as a daily staple of my life. Nothing has given me so much joy and peace of mind. Imagine my distress when, at the age of 58, I suffered a compression fracture of my medial femoral condyle. I couldn’t run without pain. I couldn’t sleep without pain. I was totally depressed. I went to doc after doc, around the country, searching for a fix. I was told that the fracture was caused by bone smashing into bone in the absence of cartilage, the cartilage gone on both sides due to years of pronation in cushioned shoes. Some wanted to cut my bones to balance things out. Others suggested stem cell transplants. All said I would never run again.

Then, learning about Chi running, I met Hazel. She coached me over a period of months, helping me to retrain my gait, to place less weight on the medial aspect of my knees and more on the lateral (where cartilage could still be found!), and to focus on a natural axis that I’d never before imagined. The result: over time, I could once again run without pain! Since then, 5 years ago, I’ve continued to put in 5-7 miles on a daily basis, I’ve run seven marathons, and I through-hiked the 2660-mile Pacific Crest Trail – all without pain! Not less importantly, running injuries (e.g., muscle tears and the rest) that I used to sustain frequently are a thing of the past.

I am a believer! Hazel is a remarkable teacher of a safe, effective, inexpensive, and medicine-free way to have fun running for as long as possible. Meet her and learn!",Patti Lynde,,"<i>I’ve tried running off and on throughout my life and I could never seem to find that “zone” that serious runners refer to.

ChiRunning has changed my life of running! Prior to incorporating the principles learned from Alice during my first ChiRunning workshop in April 2008, I had been suffering from significant calf and plantar pain and occasional severe low back pain. Done properly, ChiRunning significantly reduces the biomechanical impact with the ground - thus decreasing stress to the entire body, especially one's feet. As a physical therapist, this technique makes so much sense!!! By utilizing the combination of Strain Counter Strain Manual Therapy, coaching and support from the Vancouver Fit running club, and by incorporating the principles of Chi Running, pain has been all but eliminated to these once affected areas. During and after the 2009 HTC event, I can honestly say I had absolutely no pain or soreness whatsoever.

It took about six months for me to be able to fully rotate my left hip.  I kept doing all the loosening exercises and running. One day, my left hip suddenly  joined in!  All of a sudden, I had rotation, as well as flexion and extension. You won't be surprised to hear that my chronic piriformis pain started to resolve shortly thereafter. In fact, if I feel my piriformis or upper hamstring start to tighten up while I'm running, I just focus on rotating that hip and it loosens again. I am here to say that it may take months to get all the parts of the running form in motion, but it's SO worth the wait. My chronic hip pain on the left is a thing of the past. Training during the fall (for a HM I didn't run) and the winter for the Cascade HM in January of this year, like I did last year. My time was shorter by a full minute per mile. It was a great race for me. I ran with another woman for a few miles, and she commented on how easy my stride was. Needless to say, I tell everyone about Chi Running and your workshops. After a year, I'm starting to focus more on swinging my arms back because I tend to swing cross-body. (Cascade race pix confirmed this) and on keeping my ankles soft.

me refine my form so that I could train for longer distances. Recently, I used the very things she taught me in my first 50K,
which I finished with no injuries and a smile on my face. At age 48, I'm now running farther, faster, and more freely than I ever

from Alice, I had never had any instruction on running form or mechanics, even though I've read a lot and talked to many other
runners about ""how to run"". Even recently when I asked a good runner and running coach if he could watch me and give me
feedback, he said, ""Your body knows how to run and figure out form that works."" The ChiRunning class finally gave me some
suggestions and insight that made sense in terms of energetics, mindset, form and mechanics. Watching the video of my running,
with Alice was one of the most helpful portions of the class. I feel like my running will be more efficient and my body will be
safer as I run in the future, almost into my 50's by now. This class was a month before my 48th birthday, when I ran 48 miles fairly efficiently and injury-free.

I lost countless toenails, pushed through my knee pain, stuffed my feet into shoes, and hobbled across many a finish line. Then, I was introduced to ChiRunning.
ChiRunning has taken my daily run from merely exercise to my moving mediation and connection to my body. It has allowed me to run distances I never thought I could, and recover much more quickly and easily than I ever have.
In the last 15 years of running, I haven't had a side-lining injury. That's not to say, I haven't had my ""issues"". However, I learned to listen to my body, and make adjustments as I go ~ and I'd love to teach you to do the same. If you’ve never run, if you’ve tried it and didn’t enjoy it, if you’ve had chronic injuries, if you want to continue to enjoy running, if you want to start an exercise program, if you want to run faster and easier, if you want to run uninjured – I can teach you how with the ChiRunning/Chi Walking techniques.
Running, exercise - movement in general - is a passion of mine, and something I love to share.

Workshops and Private Instruction include a before and after VIDEO GAIT ANALYSIS. By the end of a workshop or session you will understand how to apply the technique immediately to your movement, and be well on the way to enjoying a lifelong program of fitness, health and wellbeing.","beth cline - Master ChiRunning Instructor located in Seattle, and willing to travel!",,6143,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-gray,http://bethcline.com/,https://www.facebook.com/clinecoaching,https://twitter.com/bethcline,http://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethcline,https://www.instagram.com/clinecoaching/,,12068538869,,Beth@BethCline.com,,"Washington State, and beyond!",United States of America,WA,47.5412021,-122.2675625,Marathons,3:18,,NYC Marathon,2012,_,_,,Ultra Marathons,6:17:58,82/181,Oregon Coast 50k,"October 8, 2016",Ultra Marathons,9:12:09,119/153,Yakima Skyline 50k,"April 18, 2015",,,,,,,"beth cline - Master ChiRunning Instructor located in Seattle, and willing to travel!",_,_,Artem,,"<div class=""fw-testimonials-text"">

Having just moved to Seattle, I was feeling unusual aches/pains while running up and down some of the steep hills in the area. These aches were indicative of something wrong with my running technique and so I decided to contact Beth to show me the ways of Chi running. Long story short, I learned more from one run with Beth than from a year’s worth of Runner’s World and countless hours watching youtube videos of people demonstrating Chi running techniques. Beth’s years of experience really showed through not just in her knowledge of anything to do with running but in the way she’s able to transfer that knowledge.

I have to say I’m very impressed. First, the training was great this morning and you did an excellent job of breaking down the concepts in a way that will allow me to work on them individually and then combine those into a healthier running style. I left there pretty damn pleased with my decision to meet with you. But taking the time to put together such thorough and thoughtful follow-up emails, that really takes it over the top. I really appreciate the additional advice and encouragement. Really nice. Thanks so much for doing this.

When I went to the clinic yesterday, I wasn’t feeling too well and was a little nervous since I thought it might be triggered by running. When I left, I felt better than I had for a week, this morning still feel great. Thought I would need to give up running, and now I know it’s obviously not the problem. It could be from drinking wine which is MUCH easier to give up than running. Thank god I went yesterday, had a great time, learned a lot, and felt I was running stronger than I had in years.

I am finally engaging my arms reliably and release the tension in the shoulders. It made all the difference today. I had faster 5Ks on the treadmill, but this could be a PR for road.

The blisters and overall pain had become so extreme, I was wishing I could have two toes amputated! Crazy, but seriously, it was very bad! After the ChiRunning class and learning about my heel strike and mid-foot placement, I had a brand new running experience. My toe problem was solved! No pain, no blisters, no toe problems!!

I actually remembered to do all my looseners and take my electrolytes etc right before the start. I remembered and used most of my form focuses and resisted the urge to run ‘faster than I should’ after walk breaks. I was actually able to keep my heart rate in control by varying my pace. The pre-race taper worked really well - I felt fueled, hydrated and strong during the race – I still had energy left at the end of the race. Despite just barely missing my course PR, I’m considering this my ‘best’ half marathon to date.

I packed it into my deployment and began reading it a couple days later.
As soon as I finished the first chapter, I knew this was it. The more I read, the more he reinforced my thoughts on running. It was the run reverse engineered! He addressed every current running issue I had. I began implementing his focuses and techniques when I returned home.
Later, I decided to take a week course hosted by Danny. During the course, I realized Danny Dreyer had created a method of running far more focused and advanced than anything I had experienced in the last fifteen years of running.
As a program fitness manager for the U.S. Antarctic program, I began sharing what I learned with individuals and small groups of military members struggling to complete physical standard testing. I was also joined by experienced runners who were looking to “Dial in” their technique.
For the people that were disciplined enough to apply these techniques, positive results were immediate. For those who did not apply the techniques, the outcome was predictable.
I have since retired from government service and serve now as Senior Training Partner for Redpoint Training instructing both military members and civilians. Our focus is on movement quality over quantity or volume. We initially focus on seven basic movements. The run is the seventh.
I became a certified instructor because running is a vital movement skill. I saw running as a skill, not an exercise.
Through research, I found most Americans were plagued with faulty movement patterns due to modern lifestyles. This directly translates to running imbalances, over compensations, energy bleeds, and overuse injuries. Danny Dreyer’s method not only identifies every deficiency, but provides solutions.

""Always simple, but not always easy.""

I found overriding unconsciously programmed faulty patterns takes time. But the payoff is big.

Our motto- ”Do what you love to do- Better.” (your welcome to add- Longer!).

Our training programs scale from young adults to seniors. If you are unconditioned, a recreational, or serious runner, we just might have something for you.

Train Smart,

I am also a current member of the Local 600, International Cinematographers guild.

He became certified as a ChiRunning/ ChiWalking instructor in November of 2017.  
 
Throughout Todd’s youth, running came naturally as he romped through the hills of Western Massachusetts with the neighborhood “pack”. He overcame debilitating asthma in spite of and because of running.  Running continued as a source of power, steadying chapters of his adult life to this day.  As family life tilted front and center, he would get the kids to bed, don a headlamp, tether the dogs and run for the hills to his “happy place”... call it endorphins, call it bliss, call it what you will… were it not for chi-running, he would scarcely venture there!   
 
A tale too common to runners.. Todd had to shut it down in the midst of a cold winter trail run when he became all too aware of his searing achilles tendon.  He ate his “slice of humble pie”, with the inner-knowing that an injury is a signpost. Donned with Danny Dreyer’s book, and the ensuing experimentation, he reframed these limitations as opportunities.  Todd applied the “smarter not harder” motto and in short-time, roamed these Blue Ridge Mountains again.   
 
Since 1995, Todd has worked with students and clients to address the fix “from the inside out”; to reset the conditions for health to thrive. As he tackles orthopedics as a specialty at his clinic: Pathways Wellness Center: Acupuncture for Pain Relief and Orthopedic Care, the ChiRunning/ ChiWalking methods shine as a tool for his clients. Todd’s goal is to keep folks walking and running the right way; efficiently and injury-free for their entire lives.   In working with kids and adults, the inspiration afforded by Chi-Running/ Walking is limitless; His 12 and 9 yr olds donning “sister-team” 1st place medals after their 1st race= living proof of this!  
 
Whether it be with eager students, solo, with his dogs, his kids (eager students) or his running buddies, Todd loves to run!  As a ChiRunning Instructor, he finds no greater joy than in helping adults reclaim their inner child through running with ease and joy!  He runs for the community, wonder and power, half-marathons, trail runs, 12ks,10ks, 5ks, Spartan and Tough Mudder events.  Chi-running has even nudged him into the top 15-20% of his age group.  What’s more is that all of these skills (efficiency, injury prevention, balance, alignment, etc) are so darned applicable to life.. to teaching/ coaching kids.. to parenting.. to finding a flow in an active life!  Todd is most eager to share the practical tools of ChiRunning/ Walking with any who are lucky and wise enough to seek it.  
 
In addition to being the founder of Pathways Wellness Center:  Acupuncture for Pain Relief and Orthopedic Care, Todd has been a partner at Asheville Community Acupuncture since 2009, where they have been recognized by Mountain Xpress “best of” for 8 of 9 yrs running.  He holds a Masters in Oriental Medicine from Daoist Traditions in Asheville, NC and a B.A. from the University of New Hampshire.  He lives and plays in Black Mountain, NC with his wife and three daughters.

She found herself depressed, alone, and weighing nearly 300 lbs. She was worried if she didn’t get healthy, her kids might find her dead.

After cutting out the sweets and junk food, Diane knew she should exercise. But what to do? She had never considered herself an “athletic” person. She had tried personal trainers, gyms and group fitness activities but struggled to find enjoyment. So she started walking. The walks got longer and Diane wondered what it felt like to run. She got the couch to 5K app and started jogging at night so no one would see the “fat lady” bounding down the street. Thirty second intervals of slow jogging felt like torture, but she realized something: she was stronger than she had thought, and best of all, she used the time to think through her feelings and began purging herself of the hurt, anger and loneliness she felt.

As Diane started running more, she experienced the brutal pain of shin splints. She spent hours reading every article she could get her hands on about running injuries. Luckily for her, Danny Dreyer was in town for a ChiRunning workshop. Diane attributes this workshop to transforming not only her running, but her life. By practicing ChiRunning, Diane got faster and all the aches and pains subsided. Running no longer felt like torture—it was fun! She started running 5Ks, which led to 10Ks. Could she run a half marathon? Heck yes! Can you believe this “fat lady” even ran a full marathon?

Best of all, Diane lost 105 lbs.

Diane still struggles with her weight, like so many of us do. But she realized her weight doesn’t define who she is. Diane describes herself as a runner, her kids’ hero, and the best possible version of herself she can offer to the world.

If you’re new to running, have weight to lose, or are just scared to start and don’t know where to begin, Diane is here to help. Even seasoned runners will benefit from her passion about how to move more efficiently and injury free through ChiRunning. If you’re ready to make a life change, reach out to Diane to start your own journey!

Over the years, I incorporated various ChiRunning principles into my running, but really became focused on ChiRunning in 2013. Since then I have successfully trained for all distances from the mile to the marathon using the ChiRunning technique and focuses and never felt better.

I have been in Colorado since 2014 and have access to some of the best trails in the world, so I have been able to use ChiWalking and ChiRunning focuses to incorporate hiking and trail running into my fitness program.

ChiRunning has done so much to help my running more relaxed, enjoyable, and injury free that I love to share what I have learned with other runners so they can find joy within their running practice. I have been teaching ChiRunning and ChiWalking to runners of all levels since 2015 and continue to grow my own practice as I help others.","No pain, ALL gain!",,6201,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-teal,www.focusedfootsteps.com,www.facebook.com/focusedfootsteps,https://twitter.com/focusedfsteps,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ameliaevrabel/,https://www.instagram.com/focusedfootsteps/,,9195383139,,amelia.vrabel@gmail.com,,"Colorado Springs and Denver, CO",United States of America,CO,38.8673,-104.7607,Marathons,3:26:19,,"Chicago Marathon - Chicago, IL",2009,_,_,_,Half Marathons,1:37:39,,"Southern California Half Marathon - Irvine, CA",2010,10Ks,44:19:00,,"Coaster Run - Knotts Berry Farm - Buena Park, CA",2009,5Ks,20:38,,"Oceanside Turkey Trot - Oceanside, CA",2009,,,,,,,,,,,_,_,_,20,Marathons,50+,10Ks,100+,5Ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,51,amelia.vrabel@gmail.com,amelia.vrabel@gmail.com,amelia-vrabel

Corro por placer y amor al deporte. Siempre me ha gustado la vida activa, y la práctica del deporte como forma de encontrar un equilibrio entre las obligaciones diarias, y el disfrute de la vida.

Conocí el ChiRunning® cuando intentaba mejorar mi forma de correr. Por fortuna no he padecido grandes lesiones, pero no me gustaba cómo me veía corriendo. Hacía unos movimientos que no eran muy eficientes para la carrera. Y entonces surgió mi inquietud. Cuál es la mejor forma de correr?, Qué relación existe entre la técnica con la eficiencia del corredor? Intentando resolver estas inquietudes llegué al ChiRunning, una técnica o filosofía de carrera cuya promesa es “correr con menos esfuerzo y sin lesiones”.

He aprendido y practicado esta técnica. He participado en talleres en España y en USA. Animada por el auge que ha tenido esta técnica en los Estados Unidos y en el Norte de Europa, decidí continuar profundizando en su practica y su estudio, y convertirme en Instructora Certificada en ChiRunning® y ChiWalking®, de la mano de Danny Dreyer y su equipo de instructores.

Y es entonces cuando me decido a crear Be.Runner. Así que te ofrezco la posibilidad de aprender y practicar, a través de clases individuales o en grupo. Te invito a que participes en un taller, y que el correr sea una actividad que puedas practicar por el resto de tu vida, de manera fácil, divertida y saludable.

Organizamos talleres en grupo para empresas y clubes de atletismo.

Being a competitive runner and triathlete, Sally experienced numerous running injuries over the years, which often meant pulling out of races at the last minute. The day she picked up a flyer with the caption ""Injury Free Running"" changed her life!
​
Sally took a 3-hour private class from Bryn Randolph, who was one of the first ChiRunning instructors and had been taught by Danny Dreyer, the Founder of ChiRunning. She noticed incredible results immediately after the class. Landing mid-foot and increasing her cadence were the two focuses that quickly allowed her to run with zero knee pain. This was a fantastic breakthrough, after months of knee pain, physical therapy, knee braces and only being able to run for 30 minutes before the pain took over.
​
6 months after this ChiRunning class, Sally ran her first marathon in Miami in January 2006, and finished with a time of 3:35, qualifying for the Boston marathon...injury and pain free!

Sally then went on to race in triathlons. After many podium finishes in sprint, olympic and half ironman distances, Sally qualified for the ITU olympic distance World Championships and the Ironman 70.3 World Championships.
​
​Now living in Sonoma, Northern California, Sally loves to run on the local trails and hills. Whenever she travels to a new place, her running shoes are packed and her ChiRunning focuses are practiced as soon as she arrives! She believes that going for a run is one of the best ways to explore and relax in a new environment.
​
​​​Inspired to teach others how to prevent injuries and run like the wind, Sally loves working with anyone looking to improve their form, increase their speed or enhance their enjoyment of running.
​
Sally teaches all over Sonoma county and the San Francisco Bay Area. She is available for private group workshops and private one-on-one sessions. Please contact Sally directly for more information at sally@runningflows.com. Feel free to check out her website at www.runningflows.com.

Confronted with recurring injuries and not wanting to stop running, she began looking for a better way to run and found ChiRunning by the end of 2004. Being injury free since then, she now runs on a daily basis, just like she wants to. She is an ultrarunner and has run several 6-hour races and longer.
If ChiRunning was good for her, she thought, then other people should know about it too. So, wanting to spread ChiRunning in the Netherlands and Europe, she decided to take the Certified Instructor course. She was trained by Danny and Chris in San Francisco and certified in June 2006. Since then, she has taught ChiRunning and ChiWalking to lots of people in the Netherlands as well as quite a number of Germans and Belgians. She assisted Danny in a London workshop and in the instructor training course in Dublin. In 2007 she received the title ChiRunning/ChiWalking Master Instructor. In 2010 she trained a group of instructors in Amsterdam, together with Danny. In 2012 and 2013 she did two instructor training courses, both in Berlin.
Besides ChiRunning and ChiWalking, she is also a certified Running Therapist and and Energy Control Coach (based on Breathing Therapy and Exercise Physiology). She gives workshops and individual lessons, and works with people who are depressed, have a burnout, are chronically fatigued, have fibromyalgia or have other stress and/or fatigue related problems.","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6226,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-gray,http://www.loopblessurevrij.nl,,,,,,1331813964,,marionmeesters@bmo.nl,,"Region Haarlem/Amsterdam, and elsewhere in the Netherlands, Belgium",Netherlands,Netherlands,52.38363,4.63596,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,64,marionmeesters@bmo.nl,marionmeesters@bmo.nl,marion-meesters

D.</strong>

Alan has been an avid runner since 1977. He has run over 80 marathons including 33 New York City Marathons. He finished First Place in his age group at the 2008 NY Marathon. This was a nice honor as there were runners representing every state and over 100 countries among the 50,000 participants.

Alan has a doctorate degree in education and has been teaching adult learners for over 40 years. His background as an educator, counselor, and coach, combined with his enthusiasm for the topic, make his classes enlightening and fun.

Alan’s journey into long distance running began in 1977 when he attended a workshop by the Esalen Institute called <strong>Beyond Jogging: The Inner-Spaces of Running. </strong>The instructors were Michael Spino and Michael Murphy, both accomplished authors in the field of body/mind training.

He took the principles he learned and applied them back home in his work as a counselor and educator by designing programs for special needs clients. In 1980 <strong>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</strong>, founder of the <strong>Special Olympics</strong>, asked Alan to design a long distance running program for special needs athletes. He received great satisfaction from seeing smiles on the faces of clients and staff as they actively engaged life through running. He derives that same satisfaction today teaching Chi Running.

Alan has been teaching Chi Running/Walking for 15 years and has trained over 1500 people. He is grateful for the opportunity to help others keep moving for a lifetime. People have benefitted on all 4 levels of Holistic health: Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual, so the training turns out to be so much more than just running or walking.

<strong> You can learn Chi Running/Walking with Alan by</strong>:

<strong>1)</strong> Signing up for a group workshop

<strong>2)</strong> Scheduling a private training session

<strong>3)</strong> Gather a group of friends to schedule a workshop on demand

Consider giving a private training session as a gift to a friend or loved one for the holidays or for birthdays.

He has been running since 2002 and coaching triathletes since 2004.

Form and technique are the focal points of Lloyd’s coaching style. As a coach, he enjoys seeing clients experience that “ah-ha” moment.

Within 9 months, I ran a hilly, rural 20-mile road race. Within 4 hours of finishing, both of my legs seized and I was left with plantar faciitis in both feet, that steadily increased in severity over the next year. Being stubborn (and after my doctor's advice that I curtail my running), I continued to run with a “no pain, no gain” approach while taking Aleve to manage my pain which allowed me to move somewhat normally. When the pain started radiating up to my knees and hips, in desperation I did an internet search for “pain free running” and ChiRunning was the first result. I attended a workshop a month later and my running life was changed for the best, forever. That was 2006 and I've had no recurrence of plantar faciitis since. The ChiRunning form not only altered my technique; it changed my focus from short-term goals to a lifelong practice. I run for the joy of it, and teach the same way. Whether you're interested in just beginning to run, or you're coming back after a break, or would like to run with more ease and no injuries, this is where to start. It's never too late to experience the joy of running.

If you are committed to walking and would like to bring your practice to a whole new level, we can work together, too. The ChiWalking form is integral to ChiRunning, and is a mindful and fluid technique that will lighten your step and spirit.

I will work with you to tailor the instruction to your personal needs and schedule.

Some Testimonials:

""I know I have got it now – just gets better and you are so right about the buzz – better than the “runners high” because it just feels so right. My amazing Rotorua run resulted in qualifying in my age group for the Xterra World Champs in Hawaii. I can’t go but was pretty stoked to get the certificate etc!! So thanks again for everything, it has made such a great difference."" - Karen

""Absolutely awesome. Chirunning at half marathon level. For a long period I struggled with achilles and calf muscle injuries but finally solved- I have high foot arches. I packed under these for support and a 40 year running problem dissapeared in a week. Chirunning leaves me fresh after a 2.5 hr run, thank you so much. I'll do my best to spread the word."" - Dave

It was a twist of fate which made me a Chi Runner….

I am now a Certified Chi Running Master Instructor. I have been a Certified ChiRunning instructor since 2010 but I have been a Chi Runner since 2005.

I have always been an active person growing up in Colorado with outdoor adventures beckoning just outside my door. I skied, hiked, climbed, rode horses and bikes, but I was never a runner, having suffered from chronic knee pain the minute I laced up my running shoes. Here is a 1-minute YouTube clip on how I got started with ChiRunning…

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXniigH7CE8&feature=youtu.be

I was chuffed that I had finished the Athens Marathon, something I never thought would be possible with my wonky knees. ChiRunning transformed running from something I dreaded with a passion and turned it into a life long sport that I love.

Since Athens, my ChiRunning story gets even more interesting … In 2009, ChiRunning fate would again follow me to the same running store in Colorado Springs where I discovered Danny Dreyers book 4 years earlier. On the counter laid a small flier, “Free ChiRunning Talk at 5pm today”! How fortuitous!!

I was the 1st to arrive and met the most amazing runner, Master Instructor Mary Lindahl. She was so friendly and so open with her wise advice and great sense of humour, we immediately got along like a house on fire. We talked non-stop of ChiRunning.

She booked her flight later that month saying she would arrive in February 2010 for a month. “And by the way, while I am down there, why don’t you get certified to become a ChiRunning Instructor!!”

The rest is history. Since that fateful trip, I have run countless races and kilometres all over the world, taking my running shoes with me wherever my work and travel take me.

I have taught over 300 runners, given away countless ChiRunning and Chi Walking books to friends and colleagues, trained Tri-athletes, Ultra-marathoners, people rehabilitating from chronic running injuries and mums trying to get back into shape.

I have co-taught many workshops, multi-day workshop, and a ChiRunning Instructor Training in Singapore with Master Instructor Mary Lindahl and also co-taught with Danny Dreyer, creator of ChiRunning.

I now specialize in training the ChiRunning technique to Tri-Athletes looking for that extra edge; injured runners looking to return to running, and older women and men trying to get fit again now that the kids are gone.

So, if you are looking for a technique that will have you love running forever, come and join me in exploring this fantastic technique to get you back…Running for Life!!

Hey Amy, Just wanted to say a huge thank you again for all you did for me. Who would have thought one session with you and your follow-up could have done so much? I finished up last year having completed seven races now I’ve done three so far this year and this year I’ve gotten back to some of my better times 23 minutes for a 5K 1:17 for 15 K and 1:50 for a half marathon. I got new running shoes and found with neuropathy in  my feet, the lighter less cushion ones work best, and I can get more input and feel the pavement as well as keep better form. I’ve been enthusiastic about signing up for races another half marathon in Charlotte and a full marathon in Troy, NY late April, plus a variety of others including Lake Placid half marathon and Race the Train in August. Thank you again!! You are amazing!! Judy Caswell, Belmont, NC.

Hi Amy
<div id=""AppleMailSignature"">I wanted to thank you for such a wonderful session this morning. It was so very helpful and I really learned a lot !  It was just what I’ve been looking for!!  I’ve been practicing all day and enjoy incorporating it into both walking and running.</div>
<div id=""AppleMailSignature"">Thank you again!! Judy</div>
“Hey Amy! The running is going great.  I’ve really seen a difference after implementing Chi running.  I’ve had <em>no back pain</em> and relatively <em>no soreness</em> after each run.  Yesterday, I tackled the hills of Ballantyne (aptly called “The Soul Crusher”) and felt very happy with my performance (thanks to those 45 degree arms!)  I’m still slower than my average but I’m okay with that. Right now, my main focus is on the alignment and keeping my arms by my sides.  I’m really excited and can’t wait to continue with the progress.” Raine, Charlotte, NC

“Amy, Just a note to tell you how much I enjoyed the workshop. I truly believe this technique will get me back to running and 5Ks.” ~ Karen, Atlanta, GA.
<div>Thank you so much for the clinic. I went for a run Saturday and was amazed at what a difference the chi principal made. I know it will take more practice, but I am very excited about the possibilities. I look forward to getting feedback from the video.</div>

<div>Thank you, Karen K. Charlotte, NC</div>

<div>“Hi Amy, Just a note to say thanks. My 11.5 run on Sunday went FAR better than last week’s 10 miler. While heat obviously had an impact last week, I cannot believe the difference in the my energy and my thoughts. You are spot on with it requires constant focus but then that repairs so many of the problems. I must have said “1-2-3″ thousands of times but went up the hills faster and finished at a 45 second per minute pace faster than the previous week and still felt good enough to take the family apple picking yesterday afternoon.  I plan on using this routinely now as I genuinely felt a significant difference.”  ~ JH, Mount Holly, NC</div>
&nbsp;

“Amy, Thanks for the workshop! I actually just got back from a run in my neighborhood tonight and it was my best run ever!  I was able to run longer than I ever have in previous runs, so obviously I did learn quite a bit from the workshop!  I was afraid I was not going to be able to implement the tips you gave us due to my frustrations with my shins. However, I actually ran with much less pain this evening and got excited about running again.  Thank you!! I  also just bought the Chi running book today that you told us about during the workshop.  I hope to read it, practice some more, and then if you are willing to work with me again I would like to attend another workshop to work more on perfecting the correct posture and strike.  You are a great and extremely patient instructor!  I appreciate that!” ~JC, Gaston County, NC.

Thanks Amy!  I have been working on it all week.  One of the biggest items that has helped me……… is how to run down hills!  My knees don’t hurt!!  I showed my husband last night because he was struggling Thursday when we did our massive hill run.  Enjoyed the class.” ~ Tara, Rock Hill, NC

“Amy, had a great run this am on the greenway at Freedom Park.  Ran from the park to Vivace and back in around 38 min.  Maybe 2 miles?   I slowed down to a walk when my heart rate monitor was over my upper limit.  I  love my shoes and the laces didn’t come untied. One thing I’m most pleased about is that I ran more than I walked.  hope you chi-d on this beautiful weekend.” ~ Anne

“You have truly made a difference in my long term health and I am forever grateful!” ~ SB, Charlotte

“Thanks, Amy.  Seeing the video was really helpful. When I did my workout tonight, I really focused on keeping my stride much smaller and having my legs land right underneath my body and my arms going back instead of reaching forward. I went much slower, but it felt really good.  I ran 8 minutes, then walked 2 and repeated that 4 times, and for the first time ever, at the end of the running segments, instead of feeling like I was going to collapse, I felt like if I had needed to keep running, instead of walking, I could have done it.  That was amazing!” ~ Alison R.

“Hello Amy, Your instruction has really paid off.  I ran 6.07 miles yesterday which is a new record for me.  Of course, pain free and with a reasonable amount of energy used.  Chi Running has given me the confidence for my Tough Mudder training that I will be able to finish it from a cardio standpoint.  The obstacles are another story!  I cannot thank you enough for transforming my poor running technique into an efficient and effective form.  I still find that sometimes I fall into bad habits (dropping my arms, not leaning forward enough) but am able to recognize it immediate and make the necessary corrections. Wishing you the best!”  ~ Paul K, Ablemarle, NC

“Amy! Just really quickly, we did about 4 miles this morning trying REALLY hard to keep it all together (and not sit!!!!! Elongate my spine! Look up!  Relax the shoulders! Check in with my feet! Belly button-spine! Don’t spill my Chi!  Knees down! don’t sit! Lean from ankles, not waist! Right elbow in! Don’t spill the water!).  The uphills were AMAZING!  What a difference the 45deg angle makes.  Breathing was better than ever.I have to say I felt like I was going sooooooo slow! But as it turns out, I wasn’t!   No problem with my hip and Pete felt good, too.  He BLAZED the first mile at 7:32!! So the stats are this:  My per-mile pace was 9:15 average (about 15 sec/mile faster than my last four runs).  Pete’s average was 8:20!   So briefly: THANK YOU!!!”  ~ Donna, Mooresville, NC

“Thanks again for your good coaching. I have walked a couple of times at 1/2 hour and once for 1 hours (a little calf soreness, but not bad). The shorter walks left me with NO lower back pain, NO breathlessness, and NO calf soreness. They were GREAT. I feel that you’ve given me the tools for a life change — back to regular exercise, pain-free. I’m still working on maintaining focus, but everything seems  to be working together.  Thanks again, ~ Lloyd E, Greenville

“I went out with my dog yesterday for a longer run in our neighborhood (a little under 6 miles…lots of hills).  I usually run for the first 2 miles, then walk/run the remainder.  Yesterday, I ran the entire time and felt great! Nearly 3 times the distance the first time out using the chi techniques!!  And, the best part: I felt *graceful*.  I have NEVER in my life felt graceful!!  It almost felt like I was floating.  I’m so excited about my new “practice”! So, on Saturday, when I said I wasn’t a runner….can I change my answer to “I am a CHI RUNNER”!  Thanks so much for your teachings and support!  I’m SOLD!!  ~ Karen L., Waxhaw, NC

“It felt like I wasn’t running.” ~ Amy C. Charlotte, NC

“The flying feeling was really fun and not something I had felt since I was a kid! ~ Liz Charlotte, NC

“I was able to complete my half-ironman triathlon with no knee pain, and even finished it within the eight hours!  No knee pain the next two days, either. I did the run in about 2 ½ hours, focusing on form and not speed, as you suggested, and it worked for me!  So, thank you for your help. Your suggestions about balance helped also, as it rained during the bike event, and I had no road-rash. Kudos for your class, and for your extra comments after!” ~ Greg, Augusta, GA

“I wanted to drop you a quick note of update and thanks for your invaluable lessons in Chi Running.  I ran the Urbanathlon in Chicago a couple weeks ago–12 mile obstacle course–and finished stronger than I could have dreamed.  The friends I thought would have to wait for me, well, I was practically dragging them the whole last hour.  Mile 10 was done on the stairs at the Bears football stadium and while others were fading, wheezing or throwing up, I ran the stairs two at a time.  Though I waited for my friends and finished with them this year, next year they’d better keep up or I’m leaving them.  And not a hint of knee pain the entire race. I couldn’t have done it without you or Chi Running.” ~ Best Regards, Bill, Charlotte, NC

“Amy,  thank you!!!  I have been running again for the first time in a long time and I have to say I am very excited.  I will definitely keep you recommendations in mind.  I appreciate you taking the time to follow up – I know how important time is these days…… Great class!!! Diane, Charlotte, NC

“I attended 3 hours worth of chi running training on Nov. 1st, 2008. I learned a great deal from Amy and LOVED it!! I have been incorporating it in my running and it is amazing how much easier it is to run up a hill!!!

Hey Amy, Just wanted to say a huge thank you again for all you did for me. Who would have thought one session with you and your follow-up could have done so much? I finished up last year having completed seven races now I’ve done three so far this year and this year I’ve gotten back to some of my better times 23 minutes for a 5K 1:17 for 15 K and 1:50 for a half marathon. I got new running shoes and found with neuropathy in  my feet, the lighter less cushion ones work best, and I can get more input and feel the pavement as well as keep better form. I’ve been enthusiastic about signing up for races another half marathon in Charlotte and a full marathon in Troy, NY late April, plus a variety of others including Lake Placid half marathon and Race the Train in August. Thank you again!! You are amazing!! Judy Caswell, Belmont, NC.

Hi Amy
<div id=""AppleMailSignature"">I wanted to thank you for such a wonderful session this morning. It was so very helpful and I really learned a lot !  It was just what I’ve been looking for!!  I’ve been practicing all day and enjoy incorporating it into both walking and running.</div>
<div id=""AppleMailSignature"">Thank you again!! Judy</div>
“Hey Amy! The running is going great.  I’ve really seen a difference after implementing Chi running.  I’ve had <em>no back pain</em> and relatively <em>no soreness</em> after each run.  Yesterday, I tackled the hills of Ballantyne (aptly called “The Soul Crusher”) and felt very happy with my performance (thanks to those 45 degree arms!)  I’m still slower than my average but I’m okay with that. Right now, my main focus is on the alignment and keeping my arms by my sides.  I’m really excited and can’t wait to continue with the progress.” Raine, Charlotte, NC

“Amy, Just a note to tell you how much I enjoyed the workshop. I truly believe this technique will get me back to running and 5Ks.” ~ Karen, Atlanta, GA.
<div>Thank you so much for the clinic. I went for a run Saturday and was amazed at what a difference the chi principal made. I know it will take more practice, but I am very excited about the possibilities. I look forward to getting feedback from the video.</div>

<div>“Hi Amy, Just a note to say thanks. My 11.5 run on Sunday went FAR better than last week’s 10 miler. While heat obviously had an impact last week, I cannot believe the difference in the my energy and my thoughts. You are spot on with it requires constant focus but then that repairs so many of the problems. I must have said “1-2-3″ thousands of times but went up the hills faster and finished at a 45 second per minute pace faster than the previous week and still felt good enough to take the family apple picking yesterday afternoon.  I plan on using this routinely now as I genuinely felt a significant difference.”  ~ JH, Mount Holly, NC</div>
&nbsp;

“Amy, Thanks for the workshop! I actually just got back from a run in my neighborhood tonight and it was my best run ever!  I was able to run longer than I ever have in previous runs, so obviously I did learn quite a bit from the workshop!  I was afraid I was not going to be able to implement the tips you gave us due to my frustrations with my shins. However, I actually ran with much less pain this evening and got excited about running again.  Thank you!! I  also just bought the Chi running book today that you told us about during the workshop.  I hope to read it, practice some more, and then if you are willing to work with me again I would like to attend another workshop to work more on perfecting the correct posture and strike.  You are a great and extremely patient instructor!  I appreciate that!” ~JC, Gaston County, NC.

Thanks Amy!  I have been working on it all week.  One of the biggest items that has helped me……… is how to run down hills!  My knees don’t hurt!!  I showed my husband last night because he was struggling Thursday when we did our massive hill run.  Enjoyed the class.” ~ Tara, Rock Hill, NC

While living in Montana, New York, Utah, and Massachusetts, I had the opportunity to meet folks from so many different places.  I owe a great deal of thanks to everyone for adding to my ""life recipe"". When I returned to NC I added ChiLiving to my ""life recipe.""

My discovery of ChiWalking came after completing The3Day, a 60 mile walk, to raise money for breast cancer through the Susan G. Komen Foundation. I had never participated in a fundraising walk, so I trained for the intense event. After I completed the walk, I realized having purpose in my walking was important to me. Thankfully, I found the ChiWalking book on my mother-law’s arm chair a few weeks after the walk. ChiWalking brought purpose back to my walking as well as increasing my physical ability. After practicing ChiWalking myself I trained to be a ChiWalking mentor, and now a Certified ChiWalking and ChiRunning instructor. I have reflected many times on why this technique “hit the spot” with me. They have blended my love of movement outside and my desire to understand body mechanics as well as passion for teaching. I like learning new things and particularly things that are holistic in nature. <span style=""display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #333333; cursor: text; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">I enjoyed learning about the body's mechanics with ChiWalking/ChiRunning so much that I pursued and completed a Masters in Physical Therapy at Western Carolina University. I now have an even greater understanding of walking and running gait mechanics and recognize the benefits of ChiRunning and ChiWalking even more. Additionally, I am an Original Strength instructor.</span>

My husband and I have two young kids and I have learned that ""good chi"" works miracles with little ones as well. So ChiWalking and ChiRunning certainly have the capacity to spill over from your exercise into your daily movement and choices.

 	<li>An accomplished cellist, significant because Chi &amp; cello complement each other in fluidity and alignment</li>
 	<li>An active ‘granny’ (she loves being called that) who is still very much a spiritual seeker of new pathways (Emotional Freedom Technique, The Alexander Technique, Tai Chi &amp; Qigong) to inform and expand the Chi experience for her clients. A world traveler, often with the Chi Living founders</li>
 	<li>A Registered Nurse, both in the UK and Canada, and a State Certified Midwife from England.  (Not currently practicing)</li>
</ul>
Angela’s athletic statistics include 40 plus marathons (including Boston), a couple of Ultramarathons; numerous Half marathons, 10ks, and Triathlons, from Olympic distance to full Ironman!  Angela is also an avid ocean swimmer, cyclist and tennis player.

Since first learning of Chi in 2009, Angela has lived and promoted a healthful Chi lifestyle.  Knowledge from her life’s successes and healing from her share of the business and athletic setbacks, Angela can offer her clients a joyful, compassionate approach to life through Chi walking, running and living.

<strong>Background</strong>

A native of England, with a background in Nursing and Midwifery from St Mary’s Hospital, London, Angela immigrated to Canada in 1983.

She owned and operated a furniture business, importing Antiques from the UK which she ran successfully for over 20 years. Her custom-built commissioned pieces have become collectible in the city of Vancouver.

Sports have always played a big part in Angela’s life, including tennis squash, cycling, swimming and of course long distance running and walking.

In 1996 Angela expanded her fitness program to include marathon running. She has since completed forty marathons including Boston in 2004.
Angela is a traveler and loves nothing better than meeting people in all walks of life from around the globe.

In 2003 she found a way to combine her love of traveling and running and her caregiving nature by joining Team In Training,

a fund-raising program that raises research money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society by running marathons around the world.

She became their first marathon coach for Vancouver in 2004 and was subsequently honored with the creation of the “Angela James Spirit Award”, an award given annually to the person who most exhibits the ideals of the Society.
In 2007 Angela once more expanded her fitness program to include her love of swimming and cycling by participating in triathlons. In 2008 she completed the Ironman Canada in Penticton.

In 2009 she became a certified ChiRunning instructor, teaching people to run efficiently and injury free using alignment and relaxation based on Taichi principals.

To date, Angela is currently giving ChiRunning /walking workshops and retreats in North America and Europe.

The ""chi"" in the running and walking programs refers to a holistic approach not just to the practice of running or walking, but to the practice of life.

Well, I thought that running with some kind of pain was something every runner lives with,  it was normal.  I have been running for over 40 years now and was living with pain somewhere all the time and trust me, I was gaining nothing other than retiring my running shoes at a very early age .  You don't have to live with pain when walking or running.  The bad habits we have developed over the years can be changed with the principles of ChiRunning and ChiWalking. You can learn to run and walk without ""pain"" and ""gain"" a lifetime of putting on your running shoes.

I once read, that runners/walkers not only are the strongest minded athletes but the luckiest,  we need nothing but a pair of running shoes and a strong, positive attitude to make a choice to ""just do it"".  We don't need any special equipment, facility or condition to enjoy all the benefits of our sport. No clubs, gloves or racquets, no pools, courts or country clubs, or no particular season to go out and have a great healthy workout.  

So quit searching for excuses and go get those running or walking shoes on that are sitting there by the door, in the closet, basement or garage, make the choice to Just Do It, put them on and then call me so I can help you enjoy your next walk or run injury free for as long as you want.  You will be the one to decide when to retire those shoes, your body won't be making that decision for you!

In Chi Walking and ChiRunning you will learn five mindful steps, which, when practiced, can be transferred to any area of your life; your work, relationships, health, or any aspect of self discovery:

Get Aligned
Engage your core
Create Balance
Make a Choice
Move Forward

He is happy to have worked closely with Founder Danny Dreyer to earn Master Instructor status. Jeff leads a holistic approach to fitness and healthy living. It was 2002 when Jeff was training a TNT group for a century bike ride when his wife, along with a whole bunch of other marathoners, convinced him to give distance running a go. Like many, he was a little hesitant, as running had mostly been a punishment doled out while participating in team sports. Training for his first marathon, Jeff realized the joy and peace of those long run days and was hooked. In 2006 while training for a second marathon, he picked up his wife's copy of ChiRunning and immediately felt improvements in efficiency and running form. This has greatly helped him keep up with his growing son. As luck would have it, the Chi Living team needed another staff member and Jeff joined the Chi Living team in May of 2009. He also has the good fortune to be able to run with Danny about once a week when he is in town - a great way to keep your technique sharp when the boss is right behind you!

After 10+ years of non stop running she sought the fresh challenge of triathlon.

Since mastering the technique she has been able to maintain her running form on 1/3 of the previous training volume, enabling her to pursue her triathlon dreams.

Es una apasionada del deporte que ha crecido practicando deportes tanto de equipo como individuales; en su vida nunca ha habido un momento sin deporte. Como suele ocurrir, las responsabilidades laborales aumentaron y cada vez era más difícil sacar tiempo entre los compromisos de trabajo para los entrenamientos en equipo, lo que le hizo incluir el running en su repertorio. Sus compañeros runners la animaron a inscribirse y competir en todo tipo de eventos de running, desde carreras “fun run” de 5 Km. hasta importantes maratones urbanos. Después de más de 10 años corriendo sin parar, buscó un nuevo desafío: el triatlón. Con su espíritu competitivo, no podía resignarse a perder resistencia y velocidad en la carrera a medida que dedicaba tiempo a dominar la natación y la bicicleta. ¡Entonces descubrió el ChiRunning y sus beneficios! Desde que ha dominado la técnica, ha podido mantener su forma de correr con 1/3 del tiempo de entrenamiento que le dedicaba antes, lo que le ha permitido dedicarse a sus sueños respecto al triatlón. Después de sólo 2 años practicando el triatlón, en 2009 completó con éxito su primer Ironman y gracias al ChiRunning en 2010 ha podido mejorar su tiempo en el Ironman en casi una hora.

Always athletic but never a runner, there was no way that I was going to run for no apparent reason! After surgery, however, my rehab was to walk as much as possible. Soon thereafter, I started to add a little ""jogging"" which led to some running which in turn led to my first 5K. Running suddenly and surprisingly became a passion!

Now I had to figure out how to pursue this passion safely, efficiently, and injury-free so that running could become a lifelong practice.

Being an Occupational Therapist and Certified Hand Therapist working in outpatient and sports rehab settings for almost 30 years, I have seen what can happen when one does not use safe and efficient techniques for activities of daily living, including running and other sports.

Fortunately,after thorough research, I discovered ChiRunning and Chi Walking! After taking my first workshop with Danny, I knew that sharing this wonderful discovery by becoming an instructor was what I wanted to do.

It would be an honor to help YOU on YOUR journey to health and well-being!

I can teach you to run efficiently and avoid injury for the rest of your life! The profound personal running transformation that I experienced as I began to practice ChiRunning led me to become a Certified Instructor so that I could share the joy of ChiRunning with others. Certified in 2011, I am honored to be recognized as a Master Instructor since November, 2014.
If you’ve never run, if you’ve tried it and didn’t enjoy it, if you’ve had chronic injuries, if you want to continue to enjoy running and aging actively, if you want to start an exercise program, if you want to run faster and easier, if you want to avoid injury – I can teach you how with the ChiRunning/Chi Walking techniques.

A Registered Nurse, with degrees in exercise physiology and nursing and a Masters in Health Care Administration I have spent my career in both the fitness and medical worlds understanding a broad range of adult health care needs. Working with people who value health and fitness is my passion.

I have participated in many different sports throughout my life including two Hawaii Championship Ironman Triathlons in 1982 where I finished in the top 10 women. I also have been competitive in endurance cycling, running marathons and ultramarathons. Chronic knee pain stopped my endurance running and I soon resigned myself to short runs and low mileage.

ChiRunning changed all that in 2010! I’ve rediscovered my love of long distance trail running in the beautiful Sierras and Lake Tahoe near my home in Reno, Nevada – ChiRunning allows me to enjoy running the hilly trails effortlessly for long miles. Since I started ChiRunning, I am uninjured, running mileage I haven’t achieved since my 30’s and maintaining a weight that I thought I would never see again. I regularly run ultradistance races of 50K and 50 Miles placing high in my age group and frequently running faster than people much younger than me simply due to my ChiRunning practice.

By the end of a workshop you will understand how to apply the technique immediately to your running or walking, and be well on the way to enjoying a lifelong program of fitness, health and wellbeing. It would be my pleasure to teach you the ChiRunning or ChiWalking techniques so you can experience everything it can offer you!","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6316,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-purple,MovingInBalance.com,http://www.facebook.com/MovingInBalance,@trailrunrreno,,chicheryl123,,1775-787-5825,yes,Cherylrunner@gmail.com,yes,"Reno, Carson Valley, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, Sacramento",United States of America,NV,39.52963,-119.8138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_,_,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_,,,,,,_,,,,,,,,,cheryl-lloyd,,,,,,,,,publish,110,Cherylrunner@gmail.com,Cherylrunner@gmail.com,cheryl-lloyd-rn-master-instructor

Ca fait 7 ans que j'ai commencé à courir sérieusement en faisant des ultra-trails avec beaucoup de plaisir dans les alpes, où j'ai vécu pendant 10 ans. J'ai toujours fait des sports dans des domaines très variés, avec une préférence pour les sports qui sollicitent autant le côté physique comme le côté cérébral. Quelques années de Tai Chi et de méditation ont été bénéfiques pour mieux apprendre le ChiRunning. J'ai une grande expérience dans l'enseignement et une bonne capacité à 'lire et ressentir' votre corps pour bien vous transmettre cette superbe technique et sa philosophie. Tout ça à TOUT niveau!
L'essentiel du ChiRunning est que c'est une école d'apprentissage sans fin où on apprend à petits pas pour bien progresser à l'étape suivante. Je prends beaucoup de plaisir à vous enseigner, alors à bientôt j'espère!

From the get go, it just felt right, on all levels, mind and body, being in motion and being a part of nature. The feeling of euphoria that overcame me after each run, was second to none. I remember often wondering: “How is it possible that after completing a run, and being completely exhausted, I feel so good.”

The fun was interrupted in my 20’s and 30’s, when running was knocked off the priority list. Dealing with school, developing career, and starting a family, fully consumed my existence. And so, many moons later, as life happens, I found myself in late 40’s as a classic case of being a 'couch potato'.  Obese, fully depleted of energy and a fundamental joy of life.

With my back against the wall, started to scan back to my youth , looking for a solution. Gradually got back in to running, changed few eating habits, and within 2 years lost 70 lbs.

Running is our innate capability, and regardless of age, can be practiced by anyone. Please do not believe that running damages our body.

Running came relatively late into my life but better late than never!

I have Indian heritage and was born in Nairobi, Kenya – yes, the home of numerous distance and marathon winners and runners! I, too wish I could run like those super-efficient runners, but it’s not in my blood! However, the closest I came to or my claim was when I represented the country at playing table-tennis at the All-Africa Games; the Commonwealth Games and the World Games! For a few years I was a table-tennis coach for primary school kids. After completing University education in England, I migrated to Perth, W Australia.

A few years ago, I ran my first half marathon. Have subsequently run a few more. I have been running 5 to 8 to 10 Km on a daily basis in beautiful Perth.

Whilst nursing a plantar fasciitis on my right foot, I stumbled upon an article about ChiRunning and started following it. At the earliest opportunity I attended a workshop in San Francisco with Chris Griffin (one of the founders with Danny!)on my visit to the US. I was quite keen to do the Instructor Training after that but felt I needed to work more on my own technique. Subsequently, I participated in Chiweek with Danny Dreyer and the ChiLiving Team in Asheville, NC!

Soon after I was fortunate enough to attend the Instructor Training in Singapore with Mary Lindahl and Loreen Ozolin. Have also helped at Instructor Training with Danny Dreyer in Hong Kong. I am thoroughly enjoying what I have learnt from the courses. Now enjoy teaching students in all age groups.. The pleasure is mine when the students have Aha moments!!

Recently I have been involved with Park Runs - which are a 5K run that take place on a Saturday morning at various locations around the world! They are free and run entirely by volunteers!

Running, for me is like brushing my teeth daily and it’s a practice – what better when you can run injury-free and with relative ease and efficiently! I want to run for the rest of my life and I think I can achieve it by using CR technique!

My running is constantly improving and not only does it aid my other sports like tennis and golf but also my general well-being! Prior to becoming a runner I was a little bit sluggish in the various sports I participated in. As a runner, my fitness and stamina have improved tremendously and what a difference it makes! Again, pre-running, keeping my weight under control was a challenge. But now I don’t even have to think about it!!

With running, I find all I need is a pair of running shoes and I can run anywhere in the world like beautiful Perth; streets of any city: London' Madrid, Nairobi, Mumbai, NYC, Toronto, Barcelona, Rome; the Grand Canyon; Yosemite, etc  I don’t need any other equipment, courts, courses or a partner or players! And, with the right technique….the world is my oyster!

Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned runner and would like to run efficiently and injury-free, please contact me. One-on-one or group sessions and workshops are the way to go………Happy chi-running and chi-walking!","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6333,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-black,,Perth ChiRunning and ChiWalking with Sadhna (page),,,,,+61 422 943 800,,sadhna@maroo.com.au,,Perth and surrounds,Australia,WA,-31.940898,115.791175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,119,sadhna@maroo.com.au,sadhna@maroo.com.au,sadhna-maroo

As a ChiRunning instructor and coach, Jill teaches people safe running techniques so they can implement running and walking into their lives and overcome diseases like diabetes, obesity, anxiety, and high cholesterol.  

Jill was very unhealthy in high school.  She ran track but was so bad, she switched to the shot put.  Jill entered college, suffered headaches and her academics were declining.  After a routine visit to the doctor, Jill was told her cholesterol was high (258) and she was generally unhealthy.  Later, she survived emergency surgery for a perforated stomach ulcer.  The ulcer was most likely caused by stress and anxiety and running has been a positive outlet to manage weight, stress and anxiety.  At 19, she decided to turn her life around.  She cut out sugars, bad fats, processed foods and ate more whole grains, lean meats and learned to love water.  She began running and teaching aerobics.  In turn, she had more energy, more focus, her headaches subsided and her grades improved.  She lost 35 pounds and her cholesterol went down to 180. She made a vow to never go back.  

Jill became passionate about running in 1997, after the birth of her first son.  Again, she realized running was the easiest and fastest way to lose the baby fat and process the sometimes stressful times of motherhood.  Running was an activity where she didn’t have to rely on anyone.  All she needed was a jogger and a pair of running shoes. 

After numerous years of running and racing, Jill was beginning to experience common runner’s injuries – IT band syndrome, plantar fasciitis, knee pain, shin splints, you name it.  She bought a bike and forced herself to cross train.  She discovered ChiRunning in July 2011 when she was looking for a book to listen to while driving to Aspen to run a 5 mile race.  The next morning, she applied all the ChiRunning techniques and ran her fastest 5 mile race in 39 minutes.  Not only did she run fast and feel great, she also beat Lance Armstrong.  She registered for a ChiRunning workshop in August and decided to take her education to the next level and become a certified instructor.  She has been a Certified ChiRunning Instructor since April 2012.  “ChiRunning has changed my life.  It is my goal to be active every day for the rest of my life.  ChiRunning makes that possible without the aches and pains.  It is a continual practice and what I love most is sharing this knowledge with others.”

Jill has over 25 years experience working with people, sharing her story, building confidence and unlocking people’s fitness potential to make positive changes.  She is from Aspen, Colorado and has lived in Telluride, Colorado with her husband and two sons since 1997.  She is a Certified ChiRunning Instructor, RRCA Running Coach, Personal Trainer, and Passion Test Facilitator.

Jill specializes in teaching safe running techniques, setting up training schedules, helping people overcome roadblocks and fitting a healthy lifestyle into busy lives.  She enjoys running, writing, cycling, swimming, hiking, yoga, reading, and spending time with her family.  She is the published author of “Groovin’ in the Canyon”, an inspirational story about overcoming fear, living in the present moment and never passing up opportunity.

During his rugby playing days his only foray into distance running was to complete the Glasgow marathon when he was 40. But in 2011 at the age of 65 he ran the equivalent of 40 marathons in 40 days starting at John o' Groats at the top of Scotland, finishing at Land's End, the south west tip of England ... a total of 1044 miles.

When preparing for his marathons challenge he read about forefoot striking, thought it made sense and tried to change his running style with quite catastrophic results. His cadence was wrong. He was too upright and was overstriding. He would break down after only a few miles and would have to walk home. It seemed that every training run ended the same way. It is not recorded how he was introduced to ChiRunning but he did as you may have done ... he Googled it! He then looked for, found, arranged for and got instruction from a Certified ChiRunning Instructor. That session transformed the way he ran. He truly believes that without that instruction he would not have achieved all that he achieved last year!

On his journey through the UK Stuart so astounded the sports therapists who looked after him with his stamina, performance and avoidance of injury that they insisted he go to America to qualify as a Certified ChiRunning Instructor. In the US Stuart learnt from Master Instructor Mary Lindahl and the excellent Chi Living team there. Since America he has been lucky enough to assist Master Instructor Catherina McKiernan in Ireland and he recently achieved Certified Instructor status.

Now his passion is to help transform novice and experienced runners and walkers to a style that puts form first, that is energy efficient and cuts down on injuries, that has them relaxing their way down the road rather than muscling their way there. A running/walking style that works with the forces around us rather than against them.

Stuart is working with individuals and groups customising sessions to suit the needs of clients attending.

Eventually I got injured so often that I understood something was wrong. I then embarked on a search for efficiency and after trying Pose running shortly I found Chi-running which led me to change my goals. I wanted to find the path to sustainable running and finally dropped out of the competitive mindset that used to drive me. I have been practicing Chi-Running on my own for several years now and have realised it's more a journey than a goal in itself. Have I ""nailed"" the perfect technique? NO, that would be sad, moreover I think such thing doesn't exist. Perfection lies in the endless perfecting of an art for itself.

Recent events in my professional career and the great enjoyment I now experience running have led me to play with the idea of becoming an instructor. In oriental martial arts one says that at a certain point a student can learn further by teaching others.

In 1985 I started running on a regular basis. Coincidently I also studied Tai Chi about this time for a year and started a daily meditation practice.
I became a keen runner and my favourite distance was 10 miles which I managed to run in 59 mins (6 min mile pace).
In 1987 I took part in the Peace Run an International Torch relay.In 1991 I became country coordinator for the Peace Run and remained coordinator for 20 years.During this time I ran with the team throughout Britain and Ireland.In 2005 the Peace Run became the World Harmony Run and I also joined the running teams many times in Europe and America.
While running with the World Harmony Run team in the Cezh Republic I met a friend who was an ulta runner.He was a very experienced runner and had recently become a ChiRunning instructor.As we ran through the Cezh Republic he introduced me to the concepts of ChiRunning.I found my running becoming more flowing and effortless.I was really inspired to learn more and on my return to the UK I attended a ChiRunning Workshop. Now it all seemed to make sense and I gradually incorporated ChiRunning into my running style, occasionally it would all come together and I would experience moments when running felt effortless.As I integrated ChiRunning into my daily running I started to observe other runners and saw how many were struggling with their running because of bad running technique.After some time and inspired by my instructor friend I decided to become a ChiRunning Instructor.I was lucky enough to be trained under the supervision of Master Instructor Marion Meesters and I also got the opportunity to assist master instructor Catherina McKiernan(winner of the Berlin,London and Amsterdam marathons)in Dublin.

So now I am able to combine my love of running with my work as a certified ChiRunning Instructor.
If you feel you would like to learn how to run in a more energy efficient and bio-mechanically correct way then don't hesitate to contact me.

I run regular one-day ChiRunning Workshops in central London. Each one day workshop includes, video analysis and access to a regular ChiRunning Club where time is spent on particular focuses before heading out for a run around local parks to put them into practice. I also offer 1-2-1 and small group sessions by appointment.

Specialist areas: ChiRunning and ChiWalking, Oxygen Advantage and Buteyko Breathwork, kettlebells, body-weight strength &amp; conditioning, functional movement through play.

I discovered a passion for health and fitness in 2004. After struggling with niggles and injuries when running, I attended a workshop with ChiRunning founder Danny Dreyer in 2010. This encouraged me to qualify as a Certified Instructor. I also went on to qualify as a Specialist Personal Trainer and Master Kettlebell Coach.

In 2014 I was appointed Master Instructor and Director of ChiRunning UK &amp; Ireland, responsible for the management of ChiRunning across this region. Looking to develop my skill-set further, in 2016 I trained as an Oxygen Advantage Instructor and 2018 as a Buteyko Practitioner with Patrick McKeown.

I became the first UK Oxygen Advantage Certified Instructor, teaching a programme of breathing exercises that help address every-day breathing pattern disorders alongside improving sports performance.

I work with clients on a 1-2-1 basis and also hold regular workshops in London, across the UK and Europe. I also organise and teach new instructors in the ChiRunning and Oxygen Advantage methods.

My current personal practice includes kettlebells and body-weight strength training to complement a marathon-maintenance running programme.

I enjoy running marathons and half marathons with my first venture into ultras at the Royal Parks Ultra Marathon back in 2014.

I am director of Adventures In Movement, a health and lifestyle company dedicated to improving people's wellbeing through simple practices and common sense programmes.","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6515,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-gray,www.adventuresinmovement.com,https://www.facebook.com/adventuresinmovement/,@graycaws,,@graycaws,https://www.youtube.com/graycaws,+44 (0)20 3657 9097,yes,hello@adventuresinmovement.com,yes,"London, UK.

Like many in the running community, I just accepted injury as an occupational hazard, so it was a revelation to discover through ChiRunning that it doesn’t have to be that way.

ChiRunning has helped me fall in love with running all over again, and I love seeing other runners experience the same positive change.

Siempre me ha encantado la actividad física, pero mis obligaciones como padre de familia numerosa, las derivadas de mi trabajo, amigos, etc, hicieron que a partir de los 30 años tuviera cada vez menos posibilidades de practicar mis deportes favoritos: tenis, mountain bike, esquí, squash, baloncesto…
El running apareció de pronto como una alternativa fácil, rápida, económica, en la que no dependía de nadie, y en seguida me comencé a enamorar de las sensaciones que la carrera me transmitía. Pero al mismo tiempo comenzaron a aparecer las lesiones derivadas de la práctica de la misma: lesión en la rodilla derecha, tendinitis crónica en ambos tendones de Aquiles, dolores en la espalda, periostitis tibial, y que culminaron con una rotura en el gemelo izquierdo, con la decidí que correr no era lo mío.
Durante el largo proceso de recuperación de la rotura del gemelo, mi esposa me regaló el libro de Danny Dreyer “Correr Chi”y, aunque al principio lo acogí con escepticismo (correr sin esfuerzo y sin lesiones era, según mi experiencia, un imposible!), en seguida comenzó a “engancharme” y empecé a recuperar las buenas sensaciones al poner en práctica las enseñanzas recogidas en el libro.
Ante la necesidad de aprender más, mi esposa y yo participamos en una “Semana Chi” impartida por Danny Dreyer, y finalmente nos hemos formado como instructores de ChiRunning® y Chi Walking® en USA, y recibido la certificación oficial correspondiente.
Desde que comencé a practicar el Correr Chi ha desaparecido mi tendinitis cronificada en los tendones de Aquiles (la sufría desde los 29 años) y he aprendido a correr más rápido y sin lesionarme. He completado desde entonces dos maratones (San Sebastián y Vitoria), numerosas medias y carreras de 10K; he contagiado a toda la familia la pasión por correr juntos, y por encima de todo estoy disfrutando del deporte como nunca antes lo había hecho.
Te animo a que conozcas los principios de Andar Chi y Correr Chi y los pongas en práctica. Estoy convencido de que te serán de gran utilidad, tanto si ya corres y quieres mejorar tu técnica de carrera y evitar las temidas lesiones, como si simplemente te gustaría empezar a andar o correr convirtiéndolo en una práctica saludable que disfrutar durante muchísimos años.

I've always loved physical activity, but my duties as a father of a large family, my work, friends, etc., caused that from the age of 30 I had few chances to practice my favorite sports: tennis, mountain bike , skiing, squash, basketball ...
Running suddenly appeared as an easy, fast, economical alternative, where I did not depend on anyone, and then I started to fall in love with it. But at the same time it began to appear the injuries resulting from the practice of it: right knee injury, chronic tendinitis in both Achilles tendons, back pain, shin splints, and culminated with a torn calf, after which I decided that running was not my thing.
During the long process of recovery from my torn calf, my wife gave me the book by Danny Dreyer ""ChiRunning"" and, although at first I welcomed it with skepticism (run effortlessly without injury was, in my experience, an impossibility! ), I immediately began to get hooked and regain the good feelings of running when putting into practice the lessons learned in the book.
Given the need to learn more, my wife and I participated in a ""Chi Week"" taught by Danny Dreyer, and finally we have formed ourselves as instructors of ChiRunning® and Chi Walking® in the U.S. and received the official certification.
Since I started practicing ChiRunning the chronic tendinitis in my Achilles tendons (suffering from it since I was 29) have disappeared and I have learned to run faster without getting injured. I have since then completed two marathons (San Sebastian and Vitoria), many half marathons and 10K races, I have transmitted to the whole family the passion for running together, and above all I am enjoying the sport like never before had.
I encourage you to learn the principles of ChiRunning and Chi Walking and put them into practice. I am convinced that they will be extremely useful, whether you are already a runner and want to improve your running technique and prevent injury, or if you'd just started walking or running and you want to convert it into a healthy practice to enjoy for many years.","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6351,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-purple,www.chirunning.es,,,,,,0,,RIZQUIERDOMESA34@GMAIL.COM,,Spain,Spain,Spain,40.465607,-3.950493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,draft,129,RIZQUIERDOMESA34@GMAIL.COM,RIZQUIERDOMESA34@GMAIL.COM,rafael-izquierdo

This is the question that drives longtime ChiRunning Instructor Brian Segal.  Brian grew up in the San Francisco Bay area running on the beaches and on the coastal mountain trails of California. He studied Environmental Design at UC Santa Cruz, and spent 30 years designing and building Solar Homes. His father was a Fencing Maestro and Brian also became a Maestro, competing, teaching, and coaching at Montana State University. He also taught skiing for many years. More recently, his Yoga Practice became a career, and he is now a Yoga Alliance Certified Instructor, and teaches at YogaMotion Wellness Center.

Brian stopped running after tearing his ACL in 2002.. Three knee surgeries and five years later, he decided to start running again. He decided to learn to run again using the ChiRunning principles. After so many years of teaching good posture and how to move from their center, ChiRunning seemed to be the natural extension of what he was already teaching about movement theory in Fencing and Yoga.

""I love to Chi Run! It makes me happy when I am stressed, and keeps me in great shape physically and spiritually,"" says Segal.

Brian teaches ChiRunning to all ages and levels of ability. He finds joy in helping other learn to walk and run with more energy and less injury. Most of his clients are looking to stay competitive as they age, and others come to eliminate pain in walking and running.","Focus your mind, strengthen your core, energize your life.",,6353,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-purple,occupationalyoga.com,,,,,,406-580-5760,yes,occupationalyoga@gmail.com,yes,Brian Segal Bozeman Montana,United States of America,MT,45.675652,-111.035899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,130,occupationalyoga@gmail.com,occupationalyoga@gmail.com,brian-segal

My passion for running started at a young age; representing Kent at the English schools and going on to compete at a senior level for Kent, South Of England and the City of Sheffield AC over 800m and 1500m.

After suffering a series of running related injuries that put pay to me competing i was keen to continue with running, and in an effort to prevent further injuries started to look at how to improve my running form.

In 2010 I discovered ChiRunning; a technique to reduce injuries and increase efficiency. Since adopting principles of ChiRunning I haven't looked back. I was so impressed with this technique in enhancing performance that in September 2012 I went to North Carolina to train to become one of a handful of UK Certified Instructors.

Since, I have become the RUNFIT 'expert' on biomechanical advice and gait analysis.

With over 20 years of running experience I am also a certified UKA Leader in Running Fitness

His experience spans running, trekking and climbing in the Himalaya, Karakoram and the mountains of northern India at altitudes of up to 6000 meters. These events require fitness, mental strength and the ability to work as part of a team.

Over the last four years Shane has concentrated on ultra and multi day running events. He has completed a number of 50, 75 and 100 mile runs, the Grand Union Canal Race (the longest continuous footrace in the UK at 145 miles) and the Marathon Des Sables (a 6 day self supported race across the Sahara Desert, known as the toughest footrace on earth)

Competing in events such as these set Shane on a journey to find a running form that would allow him to put his body through such long distances in the most efficient way and in a way that would prevent him from succumbing to the long list of injuries that he could see his seasoned competitors suffering from.

The discovery of Chi running enabled him to do just that, the transition was so successful that Shane decided to become a Chi running instructor. He works with clients teaching the Chi running form which can be utilised for complete beginners to seasoned runners who are looking to improve their form and, of course, runners who are looking to enter the world of long distance running.

Shane works on a one to one basis as well as with small groups and in workshop environments. He also works with sports teams and corporate organisations for team building events.

Me gusta la actividad física y lo que implica de movimiento, energía, salud, diversión, vida. He practicado natación, tenis, baile – me gusta mucho bailar , esquí, bicicleta de montaña, y soy Técnico de Aerobic e Instructora de Pilates Matt. Me encanta pasear y cuando voy de viaje, me gusta olvidar el coche y recorrer las ciudades caminando. Me gusta la naturaleza, disfrutar las estaciones, la montaña, la playa, el sol, la lluvia… y ese afán de conectar con lo natural, y más concretamente en el campo de la visión, me llevó a hacerme Educadora de Visión Natural (Método Bates).
Sin embargo, correr me producía mucha sensación de esfuerzo y me dolían las rodillas, tanto, como para tener que parar.
¿Qué sentido tiene correr si es mucho esfuerzo y dolor?

Entonces conocí el Chirunning y Chiwalking, que planteaba justamente una práctica sin esfuerzo y sin dolor. Conecté muy rápido con ello: tanto durante la lectura del libro de Correr Chi, como en una semana que pasé en Carolina del Norte, impartido por el creador de la técnica, Danny Dreyer, me di cuenta de que lo que yo proponía para los ojos y la visión, tenía mucha conexión con lo que allí se explicaba para el cuerpo y la carrera: usar el cuerpo de forma más acorde con su diseño natural, crear las condiciones para que la energía fluya. Pasar el trabajo de las piernas al centro, donde los músculos son más fuertes y están de forma natural más preparados para mover el cuerpo; inclinarse ligeramente para, en lugar de impulsarnos con las piernas, cooperar con la fuerza de la gravedad para generar el movimiento; mantener una postura alineada que permita que el peso del cuerpo sea soportado por nuestra estructura, no por nuestros músculos y relajar hombros y brazos, piernas y caderas para que el movimiento sea fluido.
Aprendí la técnica, y gracias al Chirunning, mi forma de caminar y correr cambió tanto que, aquella sensación de sufrimiento y sinsentido ha pasado a ser disfrute y alegría: menos esfuerzo percibido y no me duelen las rodillas. Ahora no solo salgo a correr, sino que disfruto con ello. Después de correr, vuelvo con más energía, física y mental y con la satisfacción de saber correr bien, con la mente y el cuerpo en perfecta conexión, lo que me permite pensar en esta práctica como algo para toda la vida.
Por eso creo que esta técnica puede ayudarte, tanto si ya corres y quieres mejorar tus tiempos, hacer distancias más largas, prepararte para una carrera, y olvidar las lesiones como si nunca has corrido y quieres saber cuáles son las claves para comenzar a correr de forma eficiente y saludable. Acércate a conocer y practicar Chirunning, te va a encantar. ¡Hay un antes y un después, te lo aseguro!
Estoy dispuesta a mostrarte como correr sin esfuerzo y sin dolor. Suena muy bien, ¿verdad? ¿a qué esperas?

I love physical activity and implying motion , energy, health , fun, life . I practiced swimming, tennis , dancing - I love to dance - skiing, mountain biking, and I´m a Teacher in Aerobics and Pilates Instructor Matt . I love walking and when I travel, I like to forget the car and walk through the cities.
I like nature, enjoy the seasons, the mountains, the beach , the sun , the rain ... and the desire to connect with nature , and more specifically in the field of vision moved me to become a Natural Vision Improvement Educator (Bates Method) .
However, running supposed such an effort and so much pain in my knees, that I didn´t enjoy at all, even though I tried.
Running made no sense to me: too much effort and pain.

Then I found the ChiRunning and ChiWalking technique, it was the perfect answer to my complain: an effortless and painless practice. I connected very quickly with it: after reading the ChiRunning book , and spending a week in North Carolina, learning from the founders of the technique, Danny and Katherine Dreyer, and other wonderful instructors, I realized that what I proposed for the eyes and vision, had much connection with what was explained about the body and the running: using the body more in line with its natural design , create conditions for the energy to flow . Transfer the work from the legs to the center, where the muscles are stronger and are naturally more prepared to move the body; to lean slightly , instead of pushing with your legs, cooperate with the force of gravity to generate the movement, maintain an aligned posture that allows the body weight to be supported by our structure , not our muscles and relax your shoulders and arms, legs and hips so the movement is fluid.
I learned the technique and, thanks to ChiRunning, my way of walking and running changed completely, the feeling of suffering and meaninglessness has become enjoyment and happiness: incredibly less perceived effort and my knees don´t hurt. Now I run, but you know what makes the difference: I enjoy it! . After running , I come back with more physical and mental energy and with the satisfaction of knowing that I´m running well, with the mind and body in perfect connection, what allows me to consider my running or walking as a practice, that makes me improve everyday and that I will enjoy for the rest of my life.
I do think that this technique can help you, whether you are a seasoned runner and you want to improve your speed , do longer distances, prepare for a race, and forget the injury as well as if you've never run and want to know what are the keys to start running efficient and healthy. Get to know and practice ChiRunning , you'll love it . There is a before and after, I can tell you!
I'm willing to show you how to run effortlessly and painlessly. Sounds great , right?

During my life I have experienced many ways of training and teaching sport. I strongly believe that ChiRunning is very unique, because it is simple but also most comprehensive technique for running.
My experience in training and teaching sport:
Graduated from university as teacher of sport and physical education.
One of the coordinators of the Peace Run- world's longest running relay.
Experienced ski instructor ( Germany )
Squash instructor ( Switzerland)
Yoga teacher ( USA )
Swimming instructor
I practice yoga, chi-kung, and meditation every day. I am an organizer of the 2 Mile Races in Prague, and also help organize the ultra running races in Prague and Kladno.

I teach ChiRunning in both Czech or English.

Pro informace o ChiRunningu v Čechách a na Slovensku navštivte prosím www.behbezusili.cz

Tento jedinečný a přirozený styl běhání vyučuji jako první certifikovaný instruktor ChiRunningu v Čechách a na Slovensku. V průběhu let jsem měl možnost poznat mnoho stylů a způsobů tréninku běhání a výuky různých sportů, a to jak u nás, tak i v zahraničí. Každý instruktor, učitel či trenér, se kterými jsem za tu dobu měl možnost se setkat, měl různý styl výuky, pohledu na věc či něco jedinečného, v čem vynikal nad ostatní. Tyto dlouholeté a cenné zkušenosti jsem získal:

při studiu Pedagogické fakulty Západočeské university v oboru Tělesná výchova a sport
jako koordinátor Světového běhu harmonie jsem naběhal tisíce kilometrů takřka po celém světě
v zahraničí jako učitel lyžování v německém alpském středisku Lenggries (Skischule Ecki Kober)
působil jsem jako instruktor jógy v Kalifornii (Pilgrimage of the Heart Yoga studio, San Diego, USA)
trénoval jsem squash ve Švýcarsku (Swiss Squash Trainer, Bern)
získal jsem Golfový certifikát (Balboa Park G.C., Mr. Rob Manning PGA trainer, San Diego, USA)
v České republice jsem byl asistentem hlavního trenéra plavání mladších žáků
reprezentoval jsem Českou republiku na mezinárodních soutěžích v karate
cenné zkušenosti jsem získal také jako hlavní vedoucí dětského tábora
mnoho let se každodenně věnuji meditaci, cvičení jógy a chi-kungu
můžete mě také potkat každou první sobotu v měsíci jako spoluorganizátora 2-mílového Běhu sebepřekonávání ve Stromovce (Lívancový běh).

Výuka ChiRunningu je výjimečná ve své jednoduchosti a zároveň ve své hloubce poznání a způsobu předání informací od trenéra na studenta. Každý dosažený cíl při tréninku je počátečním výchozím bodem pro další krok k hlubšímu poznání a vnímání sebe sama nejenom při běhání.",,,6374,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-purple,www.behbezusili.cz,,,,,,,,josef.sverma@seznam.cz,yes,Josef Šverma - Česká Republika,Czech Republic,Other,50.0755,14.4378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,142,josef.sverma@seznam.cz,josef.sverma@seznam.cz,josef-sverma

Natural Born Runners verzorgt ChiRunning workshops en cursussen in heel Nederland.
Wil je leren hardlopen op basis van ontspanning en met de focus op een goede houding en efficiënte loopstijl dan helpen we je graag verder. Terugkomen na een blessure? Wij kunnen je leren om met de juiste hardlooptechniek de belasting van je spieren, pezen en gewrichten te verkleinen en zo blessures te voorkomen.

Ook na het afronden van een ChiRunning workshop of cursus begeleiden we je graag bij het verder ontwikkelen van je looptechniek. Zo kun je na het volgen van de ChiRunning Level 1 cursus kiezen voor een Level 2 cursus of doorstromen naar een van onze loopgroepen.

Twee keer per jaar organiseren we voor al onze ChiRunners een gratis terugkomdag waarop je je techniek verder kunt verbeteren.

&nbsp;
<h2><a href=""http://www.blessurevrijhardlopen.nl/"">Blessurevrij Hardlopen</a></h2>
Iedere hardloper krijgt er vroeg of laat mee te maken, blessures. Ik denk dat met de juiste hardlooptechniek iedereen blessurevrij kan hardlopen. Wanneer je met aandacht en ontspanning loopt kun je weer genieten van hardlopen in paats van jezelf af te breken. Met de ChiRunning hardlooptechniek leer je lopen op souplesse en efficiëntie in plaats van kracht en wilskracht.

Op onze website vind je alle informatie over onze cursussen.
Heb je nog vragen? <a href=""http://www.naturalbornrunners.nl/contact/"">Neem dan gerust contact op</a>.

I was never athletic growing up. While other kids enjoyed all kinds of sports, I could only watch from the sidelines. Kids at school fought over who HAD to have me on their teams! Track & Field day was a nightmare. So, I just gave up trying to do anything athletic whatsoever. That’s pretty much how I remained from childhood and for most of my adult life.
At the age of 28, I contracted a rare illness-Guillaine-Barré Syndrome-that left me paralyzed from the neck down for 3 months. I spent another 9 months recuperating and learning to walk again. Unfortunately, things did not come back fully the way they were before my illness and I was left with balance issues and permanent nerve damage in my neck, face, hands, left leg and both feet. I later underwent surgery on my left foot to alleviate the pain of just walking. A little while later, I thought I would give running a try, but that was short lived when I broke a bone in my left foot. It seems the medication I had been taking daily during my illness left my bones weak and susceptible to breakage Defeated, I went back to being a slug! 
As time when by, I found myself gaining weight and eventually ballooned up to 285 lbs. before I knew it! At age 50, I decided I had to do something about it. I joined a gym and started working out 5 – 6 days a week. I experimented with numerous diets, and finally got things under control after consulting a Holistic Nutritionist. Yippee! The weight started coming off! As I started to slim down, I thought about giving running a try again. My past attempt at running had horrible results, and this time, it was no different. I endured many injuries- pulled calf muscles; sprained ankles; shin splints galore and a dislocated hip! You would think I would give up at this point, but I was tired of giving up on myself. Giving up on me is how I ended up being so overweight!
I started doing some research into running. I was too intimidated to join a running group for fear of being ridiculed. The best I could do at this point was run twice around the track at my gym-400 meters-so sore, tired and out of breath! My goal was to run 5K someday, and at the rate I was going, that was not going to happen.
One day, after another case of painful shin splints, I did a Google search: “How can I run without getting shin splints?” ChiRunning was the first thing to come up. That’s when my life changed forever! I clicked on the link, and I liked what I read-Injury Prevention-Energy Efficiency! Yup, that’s for me! I clicked on the link to find an instructor in my area, and I was surprised to find one so close to where I live. I decided to contact him, and if this didn’t work, I decided that I would give up trying to run once and for all. Fortunately, my ChiRunning lesson went far beyond my expectations.  After some interesting lessons on posture, ankle lift, leaning and arm swing, we started to run around the track. I remembered saying “This is running?” because it sure wasn’t what I had been doing! It was so gentle and easy on my body. We did one lap, then two, and as we started to make our third lap, my eyes bugged out of my head in amazement! I had never run three consecutive laps around the track ever! We ended up doing 5 laps and I was so relaxed and rested and nothing hurt! After some more instructions, we did another 2 sets of laps. Amazing! I felt wonderful! When people asked me how my lesson went, I replied that it might sound strange to say, but it was like I was running without using my legs!
I haven’t stopped running since that day. At age 60, two wonderful things happened. I ran my first 5K race with my daughter Kelly-a dream come true, and I celebrating losing 100 lbs! I ran 6 more races that year- three 5K’s and three 10K’s, and at age 61, I ran my 1st half marathon! I have since run 2 more half marathons and a 30K event, with more to follow.
I knew right away as I started rounding that track for the third time that fateful day in November, 2014, that someday I would like to teach ChiRunning. Then I thought, why someday? Isn’t today someday? I signed up for the instructor training course in Chicago in September, 2014, taught by the same wonderful person who taught me to run. I completed all my training requirements on March 15, 2015 and at age 61, I became the 9th Certified ChiRunning/Chi Walking Instructor in Canada! AND THAT WAS SOME DAY!
I know there are lots of people like me out there who would like to run but don’t think they can. These are the people I want to reach out to help. I’m proof positive that no matter what life throws at you, there’s a hidden athlete in you waiting to be unleashed!
NEVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF!

I was already practicing yoga, so when I read about ChiWalking® and ChiRunning®, it made so much sense to me.

Two years ago I went on a ChiRunning® workshop and it completely changed how I ran AND walked. It has made such a difference and once again I am enjoying running and hill walking. Since then I have become a qualified ChiWalking® instructor and walking guide.

I am based just outside Tayvallich (Mid Argyll) on the beautiful west coast of Scotland and can offer ChiWalking® classes for small groups and on a 1:1 basis.

Sarah has been a runner for most of her life, running cross-country and track in high school. Since then she has completed countless 5K and10k races, and multiple half-marathon and full marathon events. She runs for fun, to be a part of a community, and for meditative qualities. Running is her freedom. In 2007 Sarah encountered her first serious injury, which put her on the sidelines for a few years and sent her world into a tailspin.

Taking a workshop with Danny instantly put Sarah on the road to recovery. After discovering ChiRunning®/Chi Walking®, Sarah solidified her mind-body connection and listened to her body’s signals and let them guide her progress. If her hamstring spoke, she adjusted and it felt better. If her ankle tired, she adjusted and it felt better. When her hip ached, she adjusted and it felt better. Sarah fell in love with her practice again, and is injury free, running half-marathons again. The meditative quality of running and the process of body sensing brought her back to life.

ChiRunning®/Chi Walking® made such an impact on Sarah’s life that she knew she had to learn it and teach it to others. It is Sarah’s deepest desire to share ChiRunning®/Chi Walking® with other runners and walkers. Sarah wants to help others feel the comfort and grace that running and walking can bring to their lives and experience ease in their body as they move effortlessly toward reaching their fitness goals.

In 2017, Sarah became a Best Selling author of her book, <a href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/from-sidelines-to-startlines-sarah-richardson/1126662463?ean=9781683505167"">From Sidelines to Start Lines: The Frustrated Runner's Guide to Lacing Up for a Lifetime.</a> This motivational book helps frustrated runners transform their relationship with running by maximizing their efforts and mastering their mindset. And in June of 2019, she will become a two-time published author when Chicken Soup for the Soul Running For Good comes out. Her short story sets the stage for running her first full marathon, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

His undergraduate degree is in biomedical engineering, which gave him a great understanding of biomechanics and appreciation for the body that moves as a whole.
As a runner for nearly 25 years with high school and college success, Trent has understood how improving form can make you faster and less prone to injury. When introduced to ChiRunning and ChiWalking, everything about it made sense, plus it gave him the deeper connection to the energetic joy that is relaxed and free. Having dealt with injuries before, ChiRunning and ChiWalking has helped to alleviate some of these issues. Running and walking have become more meditative, a practice that he loves to share with others.
Trent gives good common sense instruction and really knows how to transform all levels of walkers and runners using the ChiRunning and ChiWalking method.

At his core, Marc is a teacher. As an education entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience he has served in the roles of coach, teacher, school founder, school leader, mindfulness educator, and executive director.

Marc is an avid runner with regular podium finishes. In his forties he ran a 2:51 PR in the Boston Marathon and successfully completed 50-mile ultramarathons. Marc has been practicing ChiRunning for many years and credits it for his ability to run 2,500 injury-free miles every year.

In recent years Marc has combined his deep education experience with his passion for running to coach a wide range of runners of all ages and abilities. He is especially proud of supporting individuals to successfully run their first marathon or half marathon or PR.

Lately, Marc has begun exploring how to intentionally integrate mindfulness into ChiRunning and ChiWalking.

Becoming a ChiRunning/ChiWalking coach is a dream come true for Marc as it allows him to share his enthusiasm and knowledge of ChiRunning with others!

A Worcester native, Marc now lives in Wrentham, Massachusetts with his animal-lover wife and his soccer-obsessed sons.

Marc offers a wide range of coaching services for runners and walkers… from group workshops to individual training sessions and from ages 5 to 85!  He especially enjoys working with teenage student-athletes.

<p class=""font_8"">After a few months of using the chi running method, I was feeling so confident, I decided to try for my first marathon!  Marc created a completely customized training program for me and monitored it closely through the mobile app.  It was very easy to use and follow.  Marc was fantastic in being there for me literally every step of the way - whenever I had questions, concerns, or issues about the training modules, he followed up immediately.   His positive, calming attitude really set me at ease and gave me the confidence I needed for the training and race.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">I still can't believe that I was able to finish my first marathon and INJURY FREE!  I also felt much better after the race than I ever expected.  I definitely recommend chi running and Marc as a trainer.  Looking forward to the next marathon!</p>
<p class=""font_8"">-Rich B</p>",Jenn B. ,,"<p class=""font_8"">When I learned I had the amazing opportunity to run the 2018 Boston Marathon, I knew I needed to hire Marc as my coach to help me reach my goal of running a marathon under 5 hours.  Marc not only guided me through the 18 weeks of training with an amazing plan, but taught me about Easy Runs, Tempo/Speed Runs and Strength Runs, as well as making sure I was properly practicing the ChiRunning focuses.   When I trained for my previous marathons, by the time race day arrived I was tired (mentally and physically) from the training.   Throughout the 18 weeks of Marc’s training I felt fantastic!  I was training hard, but because his training plan made sure I was running the appropriate paces (easy, strength, Tempo/speed) and mileage at the proper times, my body recovered when it needed to, and I was prepared for the harder training days, so I never felt over trained.   Because of Marc’s training, guidance and mentoring I finished the 2018 Boston Marathon in 4:58:31 despite Mother Nature throwing everything she had at us on that day.   I made my goal of completing the marathon under 5 hours because I was coached Marc!!</p>
<p class=""font_8"">-Jenn</p>",,,,,,,,,,_,Emily ,6525,"<p class=""font_8"">I’m currently a sophomore in high school, and I started running the summer before my freshman year. Right from the get-go, I knew I’d found my new passion. However, soon after I started running competitively in cross country, I became stuck in a cycle of injuries that caused bilateral stress fractures. Needless to say, I needed help. Marc provided me with the key insight and guidance, and he patiently coached me through the injuries. This past month, I’ve finally been running consistently without pain, and without Marc, I’d definitely still be hurt and not improving. His holistic approach to running and racing has given me insight that I’ll carry on with me for the rest of my life. Not only is Marc an incredible runner and coach, but he is also a compassionate and intelligent person that is capable of making an amazing runner out of anyone. Because of Marc, I know I’ll improve from my current mile PR of 5:18, and I’ll be well-prepared for the upcoming cross country season.<span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>

Her entire life has been about the outdoors, rock climbing in Patagonia, sailing, hiking and always running. A few years ago Constanza started swimming and became a decent swimmer and even joined a Masters Swimming Team. Her running story began with 3 miles runs 3 times a week and that kept in adequate shape for her ""other sports.""  Whenever she tried to do 5 or 6 miles she would fall apart! Her knees, calfs, shins... something would give and cause extreme discomfort. Constanza was in good aerobic shape and yet she could not even attempt to run any reasonable long distance because of the injury pattern she experienced. There had to be something to it... just making more effort and enduring the pain could not be the answer. From Constanza's experience in swimming, she learned that proper mechanics and technique mattered.  Swimming in alignment meant less effort, so she started looking around for someone to teach her good running mechanics. She came across the ChiRunning website, signed up for a workshop that that started in 2 days and went for it. She states, ""It was the best workshop I could have ever done."" Constanza has now been practicing ChiRunning and ChiWalking for the last number of years and has achieved her Master Instructor level. She can now run as far as she wants with no more aches, pains or injury! Please contact Constanza if you want experience efficient and painless running and walking. She is available for group or private workshops and wishes you the best run ever!

Upon a successful 5K, she set a new goal to run a Half Marathon with 15 weeks to prepare. When searching the shelves of the local bookstore, she found Danny Dreyer's book, ""Chi Marathon"" and began using the book's methods of ChiRunning and Half Marathon training plan. However, after completing her first Half Marathon and finding the race not as effortless as she had hoped, Mary found a ChiRunning instructor and attended a workshop. Armed with a greater understanding of the ChiRunning technique, she began training again and completed several smaller events - 5ks, a 10K, a 10-miler and finally, a Half Marathon. Each event was easier and proved ChiRunning is effortless running. Her running became more relaxed, injury free, and fun. With confidence, Mary was ready for a greater challenge, the 2014 Inaugural Disney Dopey Challenge, which is a 4-day, 48.6 mile event running a 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and concludes with a Marathon on the fourth day. Mary completed the 4-day event which culminated in the successful completion of her first ever Marathon.

Since beginning the practice of ChiRunning, Mary has completed numerous distances including two Disney Dopey Challenges, the Gasparilla Ultra Challenge (four races over two days totaling 27.5 miles), 20+ Half Marathons, and several multi-day Challenge events.

Mary is passionate about being active and especially passionate about running. She believes being active can improve all aspects of our lives. She enjoys teaching and wants to pass on the experience because ChiRunning introduced her to a love for running.

Jean believes that being physically active is a powerful tool for maintaining good health, and the Chi Walking/Running method allows individuals to do it pain-free and with less effort. With a background in mindfulness, Jean highly values the ChiRunning skill of “Body Sensing” – or, creating clear communication between mind and body. When mind and body listen and respond to each other effectively, you can accurately evaluate running pain and make beneficial changes to your pain-free running technique that will last a lifetime.

I could run easily, but as soon as I wanted to improve my performance - i.e. speed - I would be sidelined by injury. In my case it was Achilles tendinitis, and I was in miserable company of more than half of all regular runners who get injured every year.

ChiRunning has changed it all: I no longer get injured and my recovery time after training or race (including marathon) has been reduced dramatically. It was all due to the ChiRunning system and to my precise covering of all bases while learning and now practicing it. So, yes, one does need to learn how to run.

The experience was so overwhelming that it sparked my desire to share this extraordinary yet simple and logical technique with other runners and all who aspire to learning an affordable, smart and completely natural physical activity.

If you are a runner like I was and you just cannot improve because of a wrong technique, you are at the right place.

If you are a beginner and wish to get it right from the start, by learning ChiWalking and ChiRunning you will make a swift and safe progress towards a fantastic destination.

And if you just want to be lighter on your feet and more focused in your movements, Chi will add spring to your step and energy to your leg and arm swings.

Harrison is a triathlete and marathoner who has been active in various Ironman series and marathons all over the world.

In addition, Harrison is passionate about charity services and he is the volunteering fund-raising director of the Hong Kong Life Commitment Charity Club (a registered charity non-profit organization focusing in elderly and poverty services), he is also the initiator and race director of the renowned annual charity running event “L3C Bun Fun Run” in Hong Kong.

In 2013, ChiRunning was introduced to Harrison by a swimmer in his training group of Total Immersion®, he was then marveled by this revolutionary running technique! He found himself benefiting from ChiRunning immediately in running and triathlon: no more fatigue, no more pain, and a much better result under the same effort level.

The best things in life must be shared with others! Harrison further engaged his advanced studies in ChiRunning and qualified as a certified instructor, and began actively promoting and teaching the principles and techniques to people in different fields.

“Whoever teaches learns in the act of teaching, and whoever learns teaches in the act of learning.”, Harrison found that the more he shared this techniques with others, his understanding of Chi-principles got deeper, he also found that when his body has reached the moment of “cooperate with nature forces, return to innocence” and mastered the mind-body connection, running is not just a sport, but a lifestyle. There is a more profound philosophy in that.

In 2017, Harrison was recognized by the ChiRunning founder Danny Dreyer for his running skills and his understanding of ChiRunning principles. He was appointed as the regional director of the Greater China region and promoted to be a Master Instructor, allowing him to shoulder the responsibility of spreading ChiRunning in the Greater China Region. (Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese internal martial art)

In the past years, Harrison has trained hundreds of students in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. He also assisted Danny in teaching two batches of Certified Instructor in 2016 and 2018, including the first batch of Certified Instructor in the mainland China. He cultivated and led his instructor team to conduct promotional events, training workshops/programs and charity services in the Greater China Region.

Beginning in 2019, Harrison began to oversee the ChiRunning, ChiWalking and ChiLiving businesses and all operations in addition to the sales and related products in the Asia Pacific.",,,6433,Sign up for a ChiRunning workshop!,chi-green,https://chirunning-asia.com/en/find-instructor-in-asia/,,,,,,0,,harrison@chirunning-hk.com,,,Asia,China/Hong Kong,22.3186,114.1796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://chirunning-asia.com/en/,,,,,,,,publish,176,harrison@chirunning-hk.com,harrison@chirunning-hk.com,harrison-wong

After enduring several surgeries, 2 rounds of menopause, and eventually a full hysterectomy caused by Endometriosis, I searched for younger menopausal endurance athletes like me. Unable to find anyone in a similar situation, I had to make my own way back to faster paces and longer distances in a new body without hormones. Running has been my therapy.

My running journey began almost a decade ago and most if it was self-coached. I've competed in countless races of all distances up to the marathon. I did not begin finding real success in decreasing my times or running strong until I learned how to run smarter, not harder.  This has been the key to my own running and racing successes.

Aside from teaching others how to train smarter through the Jack Daniels Run Smart Project VDOT system, I offer both 1-on-1 and group Chi Running + Walking workshops that will help you learn to move with the proper form.  I discovered Chi Running when I began searching for ways to correct my foot strike.  This technique has changed my running life!  ChiRunning has helped thousands of runners improve their running form – reducing and preventing injuries, while decreasing recovery time. Runners of all ages and levels have improved their efficiency and performance, and now find their running to be pain-free, easier and more enjoyable.

My overall goal is to coach athletes of all abilities and show them that they can also reach their own goals, regardless of any obstacles they may be facing.  Whether you are looking to run/walk your first 5K, want to improve your triathlon performance, or are training for a long distance event, I'd love to setup a program with a holistic focus to help you reach your goals!",#coachcroft,,8198,Please contact me for Workshop information!,chi-blue,https://hustle-eat-thrive.myshopify.com/,https://www.facebook.com/coach.croft/,,,https://www.instagram.com/coach.croft,,9184097977,,coachbcroft@gmail.com,yes,Oklahoma,United States of America,Oklahoma,36.154,-95.9928,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_,_,Cindy,9024,"<em>I met up with Coach Croft to help me fine tune my cadence issues.  Her wisdom and eye for form also discovered some areas of imbalance that I wasn't really conscious of until she pointed them out.  It's important that as we continue in our sport as recreational runners we get tune ups every  now and then just like our vehicles.  I know I want to run for the rest of my life and I want to do it as injury-free as possible.  So go follow her and if you're local in Tulsa and need a ""tune up"" or help with your running, I highly recommend her!</em>",Leena,10155,"<em>After running for more than half my life, a series of injuries (plantar fasciitis, meniscus tear, chondral defect) &amp; surgery had me wondering if this was what getting older meant and if I'd ever get back to it for real.  Every time I started upping my mileage or pace, the injuries would recur.  Finally, I set aside my natural skepticism to try something that I had mocked as ""too woo-woo"" a few years back: Chi Running.  Well, after one session, Coach Croft diagnosed my gait issues, had me make two quick adjustments, and sent me on my way.  With those adjustments, I've been running pain-free ever since, and today I ran for the third time in a week - for the first time since April 2018.  I'm wary of exhibiting the zeal of the converted, but for my runner friends who are struggling with injuries, I highly recommend giving Chi Running (and if you live near Tulsa, Coach Croft) a try!</em>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,192,fireluna@gmail.com,fireluna@gmail.com,becky-croft-2

I am a Certified Master Health and Wellness Coach in the New Orleans area and I""m happy to say, I""m now a Certified ChiRunning instructor.  I was finally able to work with Danny Dreyer and complete my certification with him in 2019.  It is with great joy that I can now bring this technique to the people of the Deep South.

It doesn't matter if you are just starting off and have never run before or if you are a seasoned athlete, Danny's technique is transformative at any stage of running.  Many of the form focuses you can use throughout your day whether you are moving, working on a computer or cooking in your kitchen.  ChiRunning keeps giving back and you keep discovering things as you practice much like yoga. Reach out to me to help you start your journey.  I am excited to share this technique with you.  I will be scheduling workshops for 5 or more people as well as working with individual clients throughout the year.

I live and work in the New Orleans Metro area as well as the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.  I""m happy to schedule private or group sessions in either location with MS needing more lead time.

Dal 1993 al 2000 ho gestito una palestra a Milano come insegnante di sala pesi.

La corsa ha sempre fatto parte della mia preparazione ma non è mai stata il mio sport principale. Dal 2001 ho iniziato a correre più seriamente sotto la bandiera dello Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team. Ho iniziato con gare di 2 miglia (3,2 km) per poi correre diverse maratone sotto le 3 ore e una decina di ultra-maratone.

Nel 2005 - insieme a 2 membri del mio gruppo sportivo - ho aperto un negozio a Milano dedicato alla corsa e al triathlon. Dopo un certo periodo compresi che la maggior parte dei corridori si infortunava poichè non aveva una corretta tecnica.

Mi sono quindi avvicinato a diversi studi sulla giusta biomeccanica di corsa, trovando particolarmente interessante il ChiRunning. Nel 2018 ho preso la decisione di iniziarne gli studi per conseguire la certificazione di istruttore e aiutare la comunità dei corridori a migliorare la loro tecnica rendendo la corsa più fluida ed evitando il più possibile di infortunarsi.  In questo modo le persone possono correre più a lungo, sia parlando di km che di età - ....e con un completo appagamento.

Nel negozio dove lavoro (<a href=""https://www.runnerstore.it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Runner Store</a>) organizzo - insieme al mio collega anche lui istruttore certificato - corsi individuali e di gruppo di ChiRunning.

English version:

I have been interested in competitive sport since the age of 12.

I have practiced different sports such as football, basketball, martial arts and bodybuilding.

Running has always been part of my preparation but not the main sport. Since 2001 I started to run more seriously under the banner of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team. I started with 2-mile races (3.2km) and then went on to do several marathons under 3 hours and a dozen ultra-marathons.

In 2005 I opened a running shop in Milano together with 2 members of my running club, this is where I realized how the majority of runners do not know how to run in the right way and how running injuries were on the agenda.

So I studied several techniques, but the one I found most interesting was ChiRunning, so in 2018 I made the decision to become a certified instructor and help the community of runners to improve their technique and avoid injuries as much as possible, feeling a deeper joy for this discipline.

Ho ben presto affiancato all'esperienza podistica anche una ricerca personale sullo stile della corsa. Dopo lo studio di vari metodi ho riconosciuto nel Chi Running il più completo insegnamento tecnico di corsa.

Grazie al mio lavoro (Runner Store, un negozio di Milano specializzato nella corsa) in cui ho quotidianamente la possibilità di conoscere e servire numerosi runners e di confrontarmi con gli innumerevoli infortuni e patologie che li affliggono, mi sono ancor più reso conto come il fattore quasi onnipresente che accomuna i corridori sia una meccanica di corsa impropria, poco efficiente e ad alto grado di rischio (sebbene le cause di infortuni possano essere molteplici e dipendere anche da una sfera esistenziale più ampia).

Attraverso il Chi Running io ed il mio collega (anche lui istruttore) cerchiamo di aiutare i corridori a recuperare uno stile di corsa più funzionale, a correre a lungo nel tempo, con meno infortuni e più rilassamento e gioia. Il Chi Running offre una visione più vasta orientandoci ad obiettivi meno estemporanei e più profondi e soddisfacenti.

Po mnoho let jsem hrál golf a dosáhl téměř jednomístného handicapu. V posledních letech se věnuji převážně cyklistice, běhu a plavání. Kromě sportu jsem většinu svého pracovního života strávil na různých vedoucích pozicích v mezinárodních společnostech i v neziskové organizaci.

K běhání jsem měl vždy velmi blízko a po seznámení se s metodou ChiRunning se mne běhání baví a uspokojuje mnohem více než kdykoli před tím. Hlavně kvůli tomu, že běhání je mnohem snažší, zábavnější a dokážu běhat dále, rychleji a bez nebezpečí zranění. Jsem velmi potěšen, že jsme se stal ChiRunning instruktorem a mohu tuto metodu sdílet s ostatními.

Před několika lety jsem začal s prací a praxí na dechových technikách a otužování a stal jsem se certifikovaným instruktorem metody Wima Hofa.

Jsem také instruktorem dýchací metody zvané Oxygen Advantage.

Dýchací techniky WHM a Oxygen Advantage se velmi dobře doplňují a začlenění těchto cvičení do každodenních návyků mi pomohla přinést zásadní pozitivní dopady do mých sportvních výkonů i každodenní pohody.

Chci se s vámi podělit o znalosti a zkušenosti, které jsem v životě získal, abyste se cítili šťastní, zdraví a silní a abyste se spojili sami se sebou, s přírodou a lidmi kolem nás.

&nbsp;

I am a lifelong athlete. In my youth, I took part in cross-country skiing. For many years I played golf and achieved an almost single handicap. In recent years, I have focused mainly on cycling, running, and swimming. In addition to sports, I have spent most of my working life in various leadership positions in international companies and in non-profit organizations.

I have always been very close to running and after getting acquainted with the ChiRunning method, I enjoy running and it satisfies me much more than ever before. Mainly because running is much easier, more fun and I can run further, faster, and without the risk of injury. I am very pleased that we have become a ChiRunning instructor and can share this method with others.

A few years ago, I started working on breathing techniques and winter swimming and became a certified instructor of the Wim Hof method.

I am also an instructor of a breathing method called Oxygen Advantage.

The breathing techniques of WHM and Oxygen Advantage complement each other very well and incorporating these exercises into everyday habits can bring major positive impacts on sports performance and everyday wellbeing.

I want to share with you the knowledge and experience that I have gained in my life, to make you feel happy, healthy, and strong, and to connect with yourself, nature, and the people around us.","Běhejte, jak Vás příroda stvořila.

Seit meiner Kindheit bin ich leidenschaftliche Läuferin. Doch nach diversen Knieoperationen hatte ich das Laufen fast schon aufgegeben. Immer wieder kamen Verletzungen zurück und ich wollte mir diese Enttäuschungen ersparen. Eines Tages stieß ich auf ChiRunnung ... und belegte nach kurzer Zeit einen Workshop. Unglaublich - eine ganz neue Lauferfahrung eröffnete sich mir. Nach einiger Zeit des glücklichen ChiRunnings beschloss ich, selbst Instruktorin zu werden, um allen, die sich dafür interessieren, zu zeigen, wie gelenkschonendes und effizientes Laufen gelingen kann. ChiRunning ist gleichermaßen für Laufeinsteiger wie für Freizeit- und Leistungssportler geeignet. Dieses Lauferlebnis schenkt uns zudem ein hohes Maß an Achtsamkeit.

I began running like most people, to get away from my parents!  I also ran track in school.  My formative years were spent in the Midwest and due to circumstances beyond my control, I was enrolled in the local martial arts school where I trained for some time.  After graduating from school, I joined the United States Marine Corps and learned first hand how handy those skills truly were!  We...ran...EVERYWHERE!  There was no training, no practice other than to strap on your ""Go Fasters"" and a pair of ""Silkies"" and run 3miles in 18:00 to get 100 points for the run.  What was the standard you ask?  The answer was always the same, ""Exceeding the standard IS the standard!""  Incidentally, the minimum was 27:40. This was also the first time I ever heard the term shin splints and it wreaked havoc on the platoon!  And like most, I quickly came to dislike running.

Chapter I:

Fast forward to civilian life in Texas, and there were likely two scenarios for running:  A) A warm up to a work out, or 2) You were being chased!  My martial arts training advanced and I gained an understanding of body mechanics that I had never experienced before.  Struggling with some running challenges, a friend in class recommended the book, Born To Run, and so I found some peace in short runs to clear my head.  And so it began...

Chapter II:

As happens with many people, a promotion took me to another state.  Arizona to be exact!  A new location meant new opportunities, adventures, and people!  One day, someone on my team told me about all the places he and his wife hike and how challenging it had been for him until she bought him a book called ChiWalking.  He offered to lend it to me.  I said it sounded interesting but I politely declined as I was more of a '""gym guy"", but thanks anyway!  Later, I began dating a girl who would re-introduce me to running.  She asked if I would like to run a half with her.  ""Sure!""  I said, while quickly googling to see what a ""Half"" was.  Too late to back out now!  Like many, I experienced some challenges with soreness and cramping when running, so she suggested we take a class together with her running coach.  Running coach?  Is there such a thing?  Unfortunately, we broke up before the training or the race began, but I found myself running for therapy.  And fortunately, I remembered the coach's name.  Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni!!  A name so cool you have to say the whole thing!  I took her ChiRunning class and ran my first official 5k in November of 2016!  I took 2:38 off my best time and PR'd by focusing on my form!  The following February, I ran my first Half Marathon, injury free, and in December, MY FIRST 50k!  I was hooked and so began my love affair with ChiRunning!

Chapter III:

Referral, referral, referral...I was so convinced with ChiRunning that I recommended everyone I ran with to take the Workshop !  I even qualified for a refresher and after joining the running club with Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni (see how cool that sounds??) She recommended I get certified to teach.  Well, by now you know how the story ends:)

I'm so happy to be part of such an awesome team who's sole focus is teaching people how to run efficiently and injury free!  I can't wait to meet you and provide the tools you can use for a lifetime of running, celebrate your successes, and create awesome memories!!!

Referral, referral, referral...I was so convinced with ChiRunning that I recommended everyone I ran with to take the Workshop ! I even qualified for a refresher and after joining the running club with Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni (see how cool that sounds??) She recommended I get certified to teach. Well, by now you know how the story ends:)
I'm so happy to be part of such an awesome team who's sole focus is teaching people how to run efficiently and injury free! I can't wait to meet you and provide the tools you can use for a lifetime of running, celebrate your successes, and create awesome memories!!!","Embrace the Practice,  Apply the Principles, Transcend Your Run!",,,"Sign Up For a Chi Running Workshop in Arizona,  IN, IL, TX and Beyond!",chi-gray,,,,,RunTheRisk33,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwC3YJEe5qNj9M_I8ipSC0Q,,,hhwalker@cenlar.com,,Phoenix,United States,Arizona,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_,,,9077,"“ChiRunning is life changing, and Henry is a very engaging teacher.  Accept the feedback and prepare to change the way you currently run or walk after trying (applying) the concepts that are presented.  Henry makes you feel really comfortable doing things that may be out of your comfort zone”

“All the outdoor practice is great. And this time I really got a lot from the ChiWalking coaching. This will be invaluable to help get through the miles when I do my first 50k.  The demonstration and practicing the topics being presented, for me personally measuring cadence was very helpful and identified something I need to work on.  I love how Henry talks to everyone like he’s known them for years. He really doesn’t ever meet a stranger. :)”

“I work with Master Instructor Lisa Pozzoni all the time. It was interesting that you picked up on a lot of the same issues (running on toe, arms across the body). I did find one piece of advice that resonated that was new – about the leg movement starting up the middle of the back. This visual and physical feeling will really help with my pelvic rotation to help open up my stride at a faster pace.”

“Henry will make people feel comfortable with the process and help them to not compare themselves to others on their journey.”

What are three word you would use to describe his teaching style?  “Engaging, enthusiastic, relatable”",,,,_,_,_,1,Ultra Marathons,2,Half Marathons,5,10Ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,private,221,henry_walkerii@yahoo.com,henry_walkerii@yahoo.com,9176

Having ran and been active in sports  all my life (since 11) it felt a good time to move on to coaching.  I hold a post-grad degree in Physical Ed, with my first degree in Theoretical physics and Astrophysics. I have practised yoga for 25 years (recently qualified to teach in 2018). I also work in Adult Education as an associate lecturer with the Open University.

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-9379"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4D97FAF2-6840-4177-B8A9-CC0EB702F7F7-300x225.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""208"" height=""156"" /><img class=""wp-image-9388 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_4355-225x300.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""119"" height=""158"" />

I integrate and develop my own running programmes and coaching with a  strong focus on yoga knowledge and practice (attending professional development workshops from Leslie Kaminoff (<a href=""https://www.yogaanatomy.org/"">https://www.yogaanatomy.org/</a>) and Gary Carter (<a href=""https://www.naturalbodies.co.uk/"">https://www.naturalbodies.co.uk/</a>), A.G Mohan ( <a href=""https://www.svastha.net/"">https://www.svastha.net/</a>) ). We are all different, I create personalised programmes that allow runners to feel more relaxed, have a greater understanding of how they move and how they can improve their running form without an increase of injury. I have coached over 2000 runners, with a very mixed profile. From National runners to starting out and broken 'lost mojo' runners, all ages from 12-80! Running with awareness, running with ease, running with relaxation and stillness will set the conditions to allow you to run quicker,  pain free and have a deeper sense of 'in the moment' focus when running or walking.

I focus on developing a more mindful and holistic approach to movement (using much yoga training), allowing runners to recognise '<em>if it is somewhere it is everywhere</em>' and '<em>don't think it, feel it</em>'. We explore '<em>changing our relationship with gravity</em>' allowing us to feel more relaxed and encourage a lighter and better feeling with the ground.<em> For the <strong>BODY</strong>, for the <strong>MIND</strong>, for the <strong>BREATH</strong></em>

The yoga practice complements and integrates into the running coaching, I don't teach a 'little bit of running' and a 'little bit of yoga'. They two disciplines connect and I hope folk get a sense of the power of combining the two practices.

I also organise and host retreats in Scotland and Europe with my yoga teacher and colleague, these are normally fully booked months in advance but please feel free to visit the website and check out the retreats and email me if interested.

During that time, I also ran for both fun and training including participating in many road races including one half marathon. Then I experienced some frustrations with both injuries and health which led me to the belief that it is inevitable to feel like this as you get older which is a belief shared by many. When I first turned to Chi running in 2016, I was not aware of the scientific link of health and running performance and as a result it was difficult to gain the benefits. However, after treatment for prostate cancer and completing an Ironman triathlon in 2017, which resulted in carryover injuries I fully incorporated Chi running changes and qualified as a Chi running instructor in March 2020. I am also a qualified life coach which mirror in life what Chi running does in running and I take great pleasure in helping unlock people’s potential in both running and life.

All my life I have always been active in sports (of which a large part Martial Arts and T’ai Chi), but I also studied quite a bit in philosophy, sociology, psychology, science, meditation, mindfulness, religions and esoterism. I was a piano teacher and musician for 30 years but unfortunately had to quit. Lastly, I’ve always been a handyman with lots of DIY projects and I restored 3 houses. So never a dull moment I guess..

Because of this, a red line has been going through my life, which is finding a balance between the mind, heart &amp; body. All three have their own saying and all three should always be working together.

I started picking up a ChiRunning book in 2009, when I was living in a beautiful place in the French Alps. It also marked a start for me as an ultra-runner. I just loved and still love to explore my own surroundings and new trails! Many people in my local club were constantly getting injured and they considered this to be normal! I started looking for answers: I became a certified instructor in 2012 and a Master Instructor in 2019. 2020 marked my longest distance run as a finisher covered so far in one go: a 500km run in in great self-reliance in the winter in the Belgian Ardennes in very harsh weather conditions. It left a deep impression upon me that I will never forget! The sleep deprivation took me 2 weeks to recover from. Physically though I could run again after 4 days. I did not even have a blister on my feet, but I did get some blue toenails from the many downhills.

I’ve been the race director of a yearly <a href=""https://willemmucher.com/helipad/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">200km ultra-run</a> event since 2012, that goes through the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

I just love to teach or coach and help you to attain your goals!  I am always proud to find a tailor-made solution that solves your problem when there is no standard solution to it. I love to help change someone’s life and learn from my own students as well. I do consider one another as fully equals.

I am used to speak different languages and I’ve always been in an international surrounding, which is why I can teach ChiRunning in English, German, Dutch, French and Italian. I mainly teach on the axe between the cities of Cologne and Brussels.

<a href=""https://statistik.d-u-v.org/getresultperson.php?runner=163787"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong> </strong>Overview of my official ultras here</a>, see <a href=""https://willemmucher.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">my blog</a> for some race reports.

I still do regular interval trainings and I can still run a 10k in 40 minutes. I just rarely participate in (for me) short races. I personally prefer to remember where I've ran and what I've seen rather than just remembering my time when running in nature.

<strong> </strong>See you around!! Willem

Due to years of running injuries, Michael is thankful that, to supplement the excellent care he received from many doctors, physical therapists and other practitioners (and the MRI’s and other tests that followed), he found ChiRunning®. He vowed that if he were able to increase mileage and speed without injury, he would become an instructor – Mission Accomplished.

Michael is thrilled to have been a student of Chi founder Danny Dreyer. Now a proud member of the ChiRunning®/ChiWalking® family, Michael invites you to learn more about ChiRunning®/ChiWalking®, participate in a class and be part of the Chi-family as well.

Michael’s mission is to introduce pain free running &amp; walking with less effort to persons of all ages and abilities. Michael feels blessed that after all these years, he is able to bring his passion and experience of running to those in search of a new beginning with the goal of a joyful, holistic and lifelong practice.

Competing in road races from one mile to marathons; triathlons from sprints to Ironman, and open water swims, Michael has won hundreds of medals, trophies and other awards over the years. One of Michael’s highlights was representing his hometown as he was chosen to participate in the carrying of the Olympic Torch through Colonie, NY on its way to the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. 25 years later at age 50, he returned to compete in the 2005 Lake Placid Ironman finishing in the famous Olympic Speed Skating Oval. Michael still loves competing, but does so in a much more effortless and mindful way with a primary goal of staying injury free.

Michael teaches students of all ability levels in private and group sessions (virtual and/or live) including video analysis. More importantly, Michael will work with organizations in need.

Michael lives in Brookline, MA with his wife and soulmate Diane and their African Grey Parrots. They have a daughter Rose living in Miami and working in the Miami-Dade School System.

In my younger days I used to like racing 10 miles and my best time for that distance was 59.45.  I also liked to run longer distances up to 50 miles. From 1987 I took part in the Peace Run an international running relay. I organised the Peace Run in the UK  for twenty years and also joined the Peace Run team around the world in America,  China and many European countries. I was introduced to Chi Running when on the Peace Run in the Czech Republic. A fellow team member was a Chi Running instructor and taught me the Chi Running basics as we ran through  Czech. I was inspired by this experience to work on my technique and train as a Chi Running instructor.  I was certified as an instructor in 2012 and have since taught hundreds of runners how to improve their running technique for increased efficiency and injury prevention.  I have also trained as a personal trainer in restorative exercise with Katy Bowman and specialise in teaching mobility exercises to runners.

Dave believes that the ChiRunning method has given him running longevity by making it easier and painless.  'No pain - No Gain' is now a thing of the past.
ChiRunning technique teaches biomechanics and physics principles that any runner can apply to their own advantage.

Whether it’s to just enjoy running with a gentle 'jog',  run faster with less effort or run further I have recently conquered them all myself so am in a good position to pass on the technique of Chi Running.  I can now, at seventy-four, happily sprint shorter distances or pace myself for an Ultra.  I came first in my age group in the London Marathon 2018 and for the 2020 Virtual London Marathon I chose to do an enjoyable run over the Dorset Coast and Countryside.

I’ve already helped, younger, fitter and stronger runners than myself to improve and have also introduced running to my contemporaries.

Running and walking are ideal exercises for humans since we are supremely optimized for these forms of exercise. When we are young children, we move effortlessly. But as we get older we develop less than ideal habits in the way we run and walk. As a result, we lack efficiency, but more importantly, our poor habits place needless wear and tear on our bodies, causing injury. These injuries can drive a vicious cycle, preventing us from exercising or, at the very least, making exercise less than fun.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I had been running all my life, but about 15 years ago, nearing 50, I began to experience some nagging injuries. I discovered ChiRunning, first through the book shortly after it first appeared. Over the next few years I attended two multiday courses taught by Danny and Katherine Dryer, the founders of ChiRunning and ChiWalking. I have never been an elite runner, but in 2016, shortly after turning 60, using the techniques I learned, I achieved a long-term goal of qualifying for and running the Boston Marathon, a unique experience. Over the years I have run several marathons and many half marathons but my main goal has been to keep running, almost every day. The benefits I reap every day from the mindful, moving meditation of ChiRunning are immense.</p>
I have a PhD in cell and molecular biology, and currently, I chair a department in a non-profit, biomedical research institute. I am confident in the science that attests to the vital importance of exercise and good nutrition in health. I am also confident in the science underlying the techniques of ChiRunning and ChiWalking in promoting energy efficiency and injury prevention. Recently when I learned that Danny Dryer was to teach his last instructor class before retirement, I knew I had to get my certification.

One of my goals is to keep running the rest of my life and to use exercise and proper nutrition as my personal “fountain of youth.” My other goal is to share what I have learned with as many other people as possible.

She learned about ChiRunning slowly - first by reading the book and then attending workshops with Master Instructor Vince Vaccaro and Founder Danny Dreyer.  She began practicing, but still did not believe that she could run uninjured.

After several more workshops and meeting an older ChiRunner who was doing multi-day Ultra races, Laurel began to believe that running was a possibility again,  She entered &amp; completed a 50K Race - no ice packs required and was able to go sightseeing the next day!!

Laurel is now doing Ultra races up to 30-hours (64 miles) with no ice packs in sight and is looking forward to 100 Miles sometime in the not too distant future.  She credits the practice of ChiRunning &amp; Chi Walking with teaching her body &amp; her mind how to move easily over long distances without injuries.

Laurel was a member of the ChiSchool and saw the webinars for ChiRun/ChiWalk Instructor Training.  She wanted to be able to share this technique with others and took the ChiRun/ChiWalk Instructor Training with Danny Dreyer in Asheville, NC.  She also took an additional ChiWalk Instructor Training with Katherine Dreyer as she feels that ChiWalking is an important piece of helping others to start moving easily &amp; without injuries.

If you would like to start walking or running or improve your running efficiency while avoiding injuries, Laurel would love to help you!!!  Small changes in your posture or the way you move can  result in big changes in your performance &amp; ease of movement!!

Running &amp; Walking do not have to hurt  - Use gravity to your advantage &amp; go with the force of the oncoming road!! Enjoy your practice of movement whatever your goals!!!

Not only did ChiRunning  make the running part easier, it also got me through the mental part of that race. Without ChiRunning I would not even have “toed the line” that day. Many years ago I was sidelined with runner’s knee in both knees for over a year. I found a physical therapist that showed me the imbalances in my body that caused the pain. I faithfully did the exercises to correct the imbalances, and was able to walk pain free. But…I still wanted to run. I read about Danny and ChiRunning in my Runner’s World magazine. I purchased the book and the DVD. I also took a workshop with a local certified instructor. I have been running pain free ever since! One of the highlights of my life was going to Kripalu to learn ChiRunning from Danny for a week. That week inspired me to become a Certified ChiRunning Instructor. I took the ChiRunning Instructor Training with Danny in September 2019. I love to teach people this technique—it truly is a lifelong practice. ChiRunning teaches you how to listen to your body, how to run pain free and with much less effort, and to enjoy running!  My goal is to teach people this technique so that they can run for their lifetime!",Run For Your Life! ,,10266,,chi-green,,,,,,,717-991-0814,,KLHAIR@VERIZON.NET,,Camp Hill,United States,Pennsylvania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,260,klhair@verizon.net,klhair@verizon.net,kim-hair

After applying the form for weeks, I attempted a solo 5K and was able to run without stopping at a respectable slow 17 min/mile (a huge achievement for me!) and only stopped because I was about to be late for work.

Learning the ChiRunning form inspired me to bring this phenomenon to other runners of size or people who desire to run but have either been told they need to lose weight first, they should never run because of whatever reason, or who want to try but are afraid to start.

I love the freedom I feel with running now, and the energy I have even after my run concludes.

Tennis, swimming, basketball, golf, sailing, cross-fit, scuba diving, racquetball and of course running. Apart from active sports, running has become an important part of his life, starting first as an recreational runner and enthusiast in the 90’s and his passion grew apace since meeting ChiRunning in 2017. At the end of 2020, Serdar started to work on trainer certification and successfully completed the ChiRunning – ChiWalking (CRCW) instructor certification process in 2021, after an intensive training and study that lasted for almost a year. Serdar is Turkey's first and only CRCW certified trainer, has undertaken the duty of CRCW ambassador in Turkey with this knowledge and experience that he acquired.

When was asked Serdar`s view on how ChiRunning changed his perception of running and he said: “Besides learning efficient and injury-free running, ChiRunning is constantly improving and changing my relationship with running in a positive way. After each run, I learn new things from myself and from everyone I run with and even chat with. The most important thing that ChiRunning has added to me is “There is no limit or end to learn”. It made me realize that we make the biggest mistake by continuing to live with (and not trying to change) our mistakes that we think are right. I personally have first hand experience of continuous learning and embracing the change which makes things easier.”

Serdar aims to continue to run as elegant, rhythmic, healthy and energetic in his later years as he does now with the ChiRunning technique.

If you are interested and want to learn about ChiRunning - ChiWalking techniques, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time and any day for information.

I’m looking forward to have you part of the ChiRunning – ChiWalking family.

<strong>Sole To Soul With Andrea </strong>
<p class=""font_8"">I would say my Chi also known as my natural energy has always been geared towards being a better human, and being the best version of myself.  At 50 + years I have still so much more to discover about myself which means I am not yet complete until God calls me home.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">I have always lived my life with sincerity, wearing my heart on my sleeve, I am passionate about anything new I take on, and as I age, I feel I want to know more, which broadens my love of learning.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">I am a mother of three amazing young adults, Jasmine, Ashton, and Sebastian being married to my soulmate Terry since 1992 in Mumbai, India then shortly after, made Okotoks Canada my home since 1993.  Today I feel very blessed to be in a place where I can say I feel a sense of balance in my life with all that I strive to do, to try and make this world a better place with my strengths in music and fitness.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">My journey with Kindermusik began in 2009 when I was certified to teach the highly recognized international music and movement program for children 0 to 7 years. My love for children and my love for music found a home in Kindermusik and for this, I am thankful every day! Please visit my website at www.kindermusik.com/andrea711 I can also be found on Facebook under Kindermusik With Andrea.</p>
&nbsp;

<strong>Journey into ChiRunning and ChiWalking</strong>
<p class=""font_8"">I have always valued living a healthy, balanced lifestyle, and as I approached my 40’s I felt I needed to look after my physical fitness. I started my journey into fitness at Curves, a women’s gym here in Okotoks, shortly after I felt the urge to run again as I did years ago when in grade school. I took up running in 2010 and found a great sense of satisfaction in this sport as it not only helped me shed a few pounds but also helped me with my self-confidence. I felt so much in control of my life after a run. It almost felt complete but felt I could use more in terms of improving my posture and so went online to look for ways to do the same. I discovered Danny Dreyer’s Chi Running and Walking in 2015 on YouTube.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">ChiRunning and ChiWalking are all about posture and alignment of the body and how fundamental it is for running and walking using the basic principles of Tai Chi.  I was certainly intrigued by this concept and found it very refreshing and a new outlook into running with efficiency while avoiding injuries. After taking some training online through Danny Dreyer’s Chi Running school and being coached by a couple of Chi running coaches here in Calgary and in Vancouver and noticing huge changes in my running for the better, I decided to take up the instructor training course myself to not only be more efficient as a runner but also to educate and help other runners to improve their running form. August 2017 is when I was certified to teach ChiRunning and ChiWalking.       www.chirunning.com</p>

<strong>Journey into Tai-Chi and Qigong</strong>
<p class=""font_8"">ChiRunning and ChiWalking got me curious to learn Tai Chi and I was very inspired by my Chi running coach Angela James from Vancouver that introduced me to the sequences of the Tai Chi practice.  October 2017 is when I started my Tai Chi practice on a weekly basis and I was progressing through the sequences at a relatively good pace. I felt very present in the practice, it truly is meditation in motion and I could see how beneficial this practice can be for my mental health. Here I was connecting the dots, my Kindermusik program, ChiRunning and ChiWalking practice and now the Tai Chi practice.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">March 2018 is when I was certified by Jane Sponair to teach Simplified and Summer of 2019 to teach the Wong Style Sequence.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">I feel so blessed to have learned so much in the last decade of my life. Truly it has been a time of evolving and changing, a process of self-discovery of sorts, physically, mentally, and spiritually. I hope to continue the process of discovering the chi within me as I nurture and help others to discover the chi within them.</p>

The morning started out pleasant and cool but soon became warmer as the day wore on, resulting in some minor sunburn on the nose and forehead.  I was nervous, as I wondered about how I would appear in the eyes of an experienced running coach, but Andrea never made me feel awkward or foolish.  I appreciated how she would point out what I was doing right and then add where I could improve. Sometimes the truth about one’s self can be hard to accept, but I found her approach to be encouraging and not the least bit discouraging.  I had already read the Chi Running book by Danny Dreyer, so I was familiar with the terms Andrea used and most of the material she covered.  One of the first things Andrea did was to take a video of me running on the school track.  Later she sent the video to me with a narrative on what was good about my running form and what needed improvement.  I’m amazed at how effective this method is, as Andrea was able to zoom in and go frame by frame to emphasize her point.

Time went quickly as I tried to absorb as much of the helpful information as I could because this was for me and I wanted to get it!  We ordered a take-out lunch and went to a park near the Sheep River to review what I had learned.  When we were done eating Andrea and I ran along the gorgeous Sheep River, while she watched my running form and called out encouragement and helpful advice.  I have to say this was a dream come true and I enjoyed every second of it.  I could feel the change and was conscious of my speed increasing without any extra effort on my part.  Truly amazing!  Arriving back at the park we covered the warm-up drills and body looseners described in the book.  From the river, we drove to where there was a hill and practiced the proper running approach to the different inclines one may encounter on a trail run.  It was getting on into the afternoon when we again found ourselves back at the track where we started so Andrea could make a final video.  This video was used to compare with the first one so that improvements could be noted and shared with me.

We returned to the Siqueira’s home, tired, hot, and happy.  I felt very satisfied with all the material that had been covered and felt a more confident runner because of Andrea’s skillful approach in pointing out the wrong while enforcing the right.  My plan is to take what I have learned and practice it through body sense until it becomes engrained in my mind.  I don’t anticipate another intense day like this one, but I would like to see Andrea again next year to confirm that I’m still running in true Chi Running fashion, maybe more in the light of a tune-up session.  Running never felt this good!",Stewart Jeanes,,"Andrea is a great instructor. She is patient and kind. Most important to me is that Andrea delivers a consistent message about the mechanics of running and walking. If your goal is to ambulate in a manner that reduces the injuries common to running, then I recommend you learn about Chi Running from Andrea Siqueira.",,,,,,,,,,_,Al Depatie ,,"I had Andrea as a 1:1 instructor never having had Chi running/walking training.  At times it was difficult to ignore past running techniques and form but Andrea was patient and I eventually got the hang of it.  I liked the fact that she videotaped me running on the track.  Little did I know that I was a heel striker.  Not that it's necessarily a bad form but it helped me to switch to a mid striker and I feel I'm a better runner for it.  I've done 3 half marathons already and have 2 more to go including one in Vegas in November.
I highly recommend Andrea as an instructor. You won't be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,chirunning-chiwalking-instructor,,,,,,,,,publish,33,andreat711@gmail.com,andreat711@gmail.com,andrea-siqueira

I was a runner in my late 20s and set a goal to run a marathon. On my way, I suffered the typical overuse injuries runners have. But I reached my goal. I finished my marathon. Then I quit running. Not right away. It was a slow and gradual taper that led to a quit.

In 2017, a friend completed his first 50 mile trail race. I looked at his pictures and said, ""That looks like fun. I bet I can run again."" I ran my trail mile the next day. I told no one, but my goal was to run, the next year, the same 50 mile race my friend had done.
<h3>ChiRunning made all the difference</h3>
After a few weeks, I was starting to feel the same strains that I knew would develop into injuries.  Another friend of mine told me I should look into ChiRunning. I got the book and videos and found the form helped me run efficiently and without injuries.

I reached my goal of running the Hawk 50 mile trail race in 2018. Then in 2019 I ran a 100 mile race. I've been injury free for all my training and racing. ChiRunning let me rediscover how much fun it is to move through the world on my own two feet. And I fell in love with trail running and spending time in nature.

My passion as a ChiRunning + Walking instructor is to help others be able to accomplish goals they never imagined possible, whether its a 5K or a 50K or having a vision to be a life-long runner.","Ultramarathon runner and mindset coach in Kansas City, Kansas",,10576,,chi-green,ericdeeter.com,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-deeter-6769111/,https://www.instagram.com/ericdeeter/,,9135793354,,eric@ericdeeter.com,,"Kansas City, KS, USA",USA,Kansas, 39.133256°,-94.835775°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,271,eric@ericdeeter.com,eric@ericdeeter.com,10574
