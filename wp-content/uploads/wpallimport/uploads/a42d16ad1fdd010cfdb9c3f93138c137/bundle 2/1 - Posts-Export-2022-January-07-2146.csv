180,"Midfoot strike, Forefoot Strike or Heel Strike, which one is Best?","<h5></h5>
There seems to be much debate in the running community today on what is the best footstrike for running. Runners of all levels divide themselves into three basic camps: the midfoot strikers, the forefoot strikers and the heel strikers. So, here is my attempt to put forward my best understanding of the three basic types of foot strike and what each one does for a runner.

<strong>The Midfoot Strike</strong>
The midfoot strike is characterized as having your heel and the ball of your foot touching the ground simultaneously with each foot strike. You can see this very clearly when you watch young children run. They always land with their whole foot on the ground. I would say that at most people run this way as kids.

In the ChiRunning technique, we promote the midfoot strike because it is, for most runners, the most injury-preventive way to run. Our emphasis is on preventing the lower legs (including the knees) from over-working, because this area of the body is where, <em>conservatively speaking</em>, 90% of all running injuries occur. Plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis, shin splints, calf pulls, knee pain, IT band problems, over-pronation, bunions, metatarsal and tibial stress fractures, and hammer toes lead the list of the most common running injuries. This list is immense compared to everything that can go wrong <em>above</em> the knees.

The propulsion in ChiRunning comes from allowing your body to fall forward with the pull of gravity, not from pushing yourself forward with your feet and legs. For this reason it is more energy-efficient because your legs are not required for propulsion. When your feet come down onto the ground, they land either under your center of mass, in a midfoot strike. When you lean into the pull of gravity, the only work required of your legs is to provide momentary support for your body between strides. Landing on your midfoot, in most cases, either reduces or eliminates the work done by A.) the lower leg muscles…especially the shins and calves, and B.) the two tendons that are most commonly injured… the plantar tendon and the achilles tendon.

The ChiRunning technique is primarily focused on energy efficiency and injury-prevention with speed being a secondary focus.

<strong>The Forefoot Strike</strong>
The forefoot is basically the balls of the feet. If your heels don’t touch the ground when you run, you’re a forefoot striker.

Sprinters, middle-distance runners, and some triathletes tend to prefer running on the forefoot because of the extra speed obtained by “paw-back” and “toeing off.” This way of running is great if you want lots of speed, but it puts the responsibility for most of the body’s propulsion squarely onto the legs…especially the lower legs. Some of the faster elite middle-distance runners (i.e. Kenyans, Moroccans, Ethiopians, Mexicans) run with a forward lean added in combination with a forefoot strike. This takes some but not all of the burden off the lower legs.

Because forefoot running is primarily used for running at faster speeds, energy efficiency tends to take a distant back seat. As far as being injury-preventive, forefoot striking helps prevent knee injuries because it lowers the impact to the knees. This is a good thing. But the problem with it is that running on the balls of your feet <em>increases</em> the workload on your calves, shins, achilles tendons, and plantar tendons, so you risk either overworking a muscle or pulling a tendon if you go too far or too fast while running on your forefeet.

Another type of forefoot landing is when running barefoot, or in minimalist shoes. Because there is no cushioning in a minimal shoe, or barefoot, the runner lands on the forefoot, but immediately comes down onto the full foot during the support stance of her stride. This keeps the lower leg muscles from being overused or injured. Many people experience sore calves when switching to minimalist running, which makes it even that much more important to always relax the lower legs when landing.

<strong>The Heel Strike</strong>
Heel striking is when your heel strikes the ground in front of your body. At least 75% of all runners run with a heel strike. The interesting thing about this fact is that, although it is by far the most common of all the footstrike patterns, it is not done by choice, but by default. The vast majority of all runners are not elite runners or competitors, they’re just regular folks like you and me, who like to run and like to stay fit.

Most recreational runners tend to run with their body in an upright position… with no lean at all. This forces them to have to reach forward with their legs when they run…and when you run upright and reach with your legs, your feet will <em>always</em> land in front of your body and your heels will come down first. When you run this way, you’re basically putting on the brakes with each stride, which sends a lot of impact to your lower legs and knees. For this reason, many heel strikers complain of knee pain at some point in their running career. This is the group that keeps orthopedists and physical therapists in business.

But, just because you might be a heel striker, it doesn’t mean you’re doomed to be a heel striker for the rest of your life. Work on improving your running technique. If you can learn to run safely and efficiently, you’ll be eliminating the causes of running injuries and you won’t have to worry about ending up in a doctor’s office getting fixed.

The midfoot strike works for most runners…the forefoot strike works for some runners…but, the heel strike doesn’t seem to work well for anybody. Try all three and see which one works the best for you.

420,How to Prevent Knee Pain from Running,"There's a reason why knee pain is often referred to as ""Runner's Knee."" Current statistics report that 30 - 50% of <em>all </em>runners get knee pain from running every year. That's a pretty high number, and it's one of the biggest reasons why running gets labeled as a high-injury sport.

I have my own take on running and it's a little different. It's that running is blamed for knee pain when it's not actuality running that causes problems. It's the <em>way</em> people run that leads to pain and injury. The truth is, if you can learn to run with proper running form, where there is minimal impact or undue stress to your knees, you'll never have knee problems. It's a surprisingly simple fix, and entirely possible, contrary to what many people believe.

Here are some ways to improve your running technique, avoid knee pain, and insure that you can run for many more years without ever having to give it all up someday because your knees are toast.

[caption id=""attachment_2766"" align=""alignright"" width=""250""]<img class=""wp-image-2766"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2018-05-27-at-11.36.33-AM.png"" alt=""Runner creating knee pain by over-reaching with their legs"" width=""250"" height=""245"" /> Over-striding creates a heel strike[/caption]
<h5><strong>Avoid heel striking</strong></h5>
Don't over-stride and let your feet get ahead of you. Always make it a point to NEVER step past your knees, and learn to let your legs swing <em>rearward</em>, not forward. When your feet land in front of your knees, you putting on the brakes with every foot strike, sending a major impact to your knees, which were never designed to be shock absorbers.

Eventually, all of this impact to your knees leads to either joint pain or soreness in your muscles. If this happens to you, listen to what your body is trying to tell you, and change your stride mechanics, or you could end up on the bench.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Always lean from your ankles and let your stride open up behind you. Let your feet land beneath you instead of in front of you.
<h5><strong>Don't lift your knees when you run</strong></h5>
<img class=""wp-image-5203 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/CR-Stride-2-1-185x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""209"" height=""339"" />

That's right. Pay no attention to the advice of all those running magazines that tell you to lift your knees and reach forward for a longer stride. That advice is intended for sprinters... and certainly not how you should run any distance longer than a mile. Lifting your knees, makes your feet hit the ground <em>in front</em> of your body and you'll be putting on the brakes with every stride.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Keep your knees swinging low. At the back end of each stride, bend your knees and let your heels float up behind you. You should always be thinking, ""<a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/blog/what-a-real-chirunner-looks-like/"">knees down, heels up</a>.""
<h5></h5>
<h5><strong>Lean your entire body forward</strong></h5>
Remember, anytime your foot comes down in front of your body, you're putting the brakes and the shock of that deceleration is going straight into your knees.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Always try to land in a <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/blog/running-with-a-relaxed-midfoot-strike/"">midfoot strike</a>.
<h5><strong>Keep your knees soft and bent</strong></h5>
Many runners over-stride and then straighten their knees as they land. This creates an incredible amount of impact to the heel and the knee.
<strong>What to do:</strong> Make a pact with yourself that you will never again straighten your legs when you run. Problem solved.
<h5><strong>Keep your feet aimed in the direction you are running</strong></h5>
If your feet splay it can create knee pain because you're torquing your knee with every foot strike. Imagine someone grabbing your ankle and twisting it to the outside 1200 times every 10 minutes!<img class=""wp-image-5204 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Alignment.Directional-300x227.png"" alt="""" width=""263"" height=""199"" />

<strong>What to do:</strong> Always run with your feet pointed in the direction you're headed. Rotate your entire leg inward towards your centerline until your feet are parallel and pointing forward. This can permanently fix your problem by strengthening your adductors to realign your legs. Then, your knees will hinge in the direction they were designed to, instead of twisting as they bend. Foot splay can create inflammation in the iliotibial band which, at its lower end, attaches to the tibia just below your knee. The misalignment of your legs can often be mistaken for a knee problem.
<strong>More to do:</strong> Increase the amount of medial rotation of your legs over a number of weeks to give your legs time to adjust to their new direction of movement. Changing the biomechanics of your body takes time and persistence, but it's well worth it if you want to never have knee pain again.
<h5><strong>Don't rely on cushioned shoes to fix your knees</strong></h5>
It's always better to fix a running form problem from the inside out. For this reason it's better to adopt proper running form, rather than rely on cushioned running shoes, which can actually exacerbate knee problems. My favorite brands are <a href=""http://www.xeroshoes.com/go/chirunning"">Xero Shoes </a>and Lems!
<strong>What to do:</strong> Go for low-profile neutral shoes and run with a shorter stride to reduce impact. Allow your body lots of time to make the necessary adjustments toward a softer landing.

Taking good care of your knees should be a high priority, especially if you want to continue to enjoy running year after year. Reducing torque and impact are the two best places to work on your running form. This is how you begin to build a life insurance policy for your knees, and they'll thank you every time you lace up.

580,10 Tips to Keep Your Legs Fresh and Healthy for Your Next Run,"How many times have you started a run and felt like your legs were made of concrete? Surprisingly, they might not feel so bad from something that you <em>did</em> as from something that you <em>didn’t</em> do. Taking good care of your legs before and after running can improve the ease in your running workouts, increase performance, and even speed up your recovery time.
<div>
<h4><strong>Before Running:</strong></h4>
<h5>1. Fueling</h5>
We suggest eating at least 3 hours before running. Be aware that almost nothing you eat immediately before a run will digest enough to give you energy during your run. If you have to eat, choose foods you can easily absorb, such as a banana, a spoonful of honey, or a handful of dried fruit.
<h5>2. Hydration</h5>
Drink at least 8 oz. of water a half hour before your workout. If you're going for longer than a 10K, you might consider taking a water bottle or planning a route that has water stops along the way. Staying hydrated can help reduce lactic acid build-up and keep your legs from cramping, especially in hot weather.
<h5>3. <strong>Loosen up</strong></h5>
Conventional wisdom is now recommends not to stretch <em>before</em> running. But, we recommend you try the ChiRunning Body Looseners instead. Ankle rolls, hip rotations, and knee circles are a few gentle exercises you can do to get your body loose and relaxed without straining cold muscles and joints. See the <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/product/chirunning-book/"">ChiRunning book</a> or <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/product/chirunning-dvd/"">DVD</a> for a detailed explanations.
<h5>4. Start off slowly</h5>
Begin running with a very relaxed, but shorter stride - not too fast. Increase your pace slowly until you're running at your desired level. If you take off too fast, you risk ""running out of gas"" or producing too much lactic acid for your leg to burn off, and you’ll feel more soreness in your legs afterwards.
<h5>5. Check your shoes</h5>
Track the mileage on your running shoes. At about 500 miles, mid-soles can become too compressed to return to their original shape between runs, and your feet and legs will begin to notice. Be sure to <a href=""https://az675379.vo.msecnd.net/media/2273362/lcdc-24x36-posterchaussures3-en.pdf"">replace your running shoes</a> regularly. Make sure you are running in the best running shoes for you.

[thrive_leads id='5814']
<h4><strong>After Running:</strong></h4>
<h5>6. Stretch it out</h5>
After a 3-5 minute cool down jog, stretch thoroughly. Don't just jump back into your car and head off to your next event, or you could be walking around with tight legs for the rest of the day. Doing a <a href=""https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-07-traditional-doesnt.html"">cool down and then stretching</a> period allows the lactic acid (created by your muscles) to be flushed out into your bloodstream and eliminated from your body. It can also release any residual tension in your legs.
<h5>7. Soak for circulation</h5>
Take a hot bath or relax in a hot tub after your workout if you can. Soaking your legs warms your muscles, relaxes them, and aids in <a href=""https://www.active.com/fitness/articles/6-ways-to-improve-blood-circulation"">flushing out toxins and surplus lactic acid</a> released during exercise. Unfortunately, a shower doesn't work as well,  but it's still good for your legs if a bath is out of the question.
<h5>8. Freshen your legs</h5>
Do ""leg drains"" by lying on your back with your legs extended vertically and feet propped against a wall for 3-4 minutes. This drains the old blood out of your legs so fresh, clean blood can be pumped back into them when you stand up. You can do leg drains either immediately after stretching or after soaking. Either way, you'll feel a marked difference in your legs afterwards.
<h5>9. Refuel your system</h5>
After strenuous workouts, your next two meals should be solid protein meals to help rebuild your muscles. Add in a hearty green salad and fresh vegetables to replenish your system with valuable minerals.
<h5>10. Rehydrate</h5>
Whether or not you're a regular runner, you should be drinking water all day long. Eight to ten glasses of water spread throughout the day will replenish the fluid lost to exercise. Don't drink your water all at once; just sip it... but keep an even flow going.

The more time you spend taking care of your body between runs, the more it will reward you with many years of enjoyable workouts. You'll also notice an increase in your performance levels. It's a universal law: the more preparation we put into something, the better the results. The same applies to your ChiRunning technique... as your running form gets more efficient, you can expect your <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/blog/what-makes-chi-training-different/"">recovery time to <em>decrease</em></a>. What's not to like about that?

1074,The Quickest Way to Improve Your Running with a Metronome,"<h5>Your body thrives on rhythm</h5>
Your heart beat, your breath rate, your love for dancing, are all based on rhythms in your body or rhythms that you've established in your life. The more rhythms you establish, the better your body likes it.

When you're body has a rhythm to follow it doesn't work as hard. It knows what to do and when to do it. If you go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, your body experiences a rhythm... ""now I get to rest, now it's time to get up.""

One rhythm I'm acutely aware of when I run, is my cadence…the number of strides I take per minute. I have found that most people do best when they run with a steady rhythmical cadence. It varies slightly from person to person based on height, body structure and personality type, but the optimal cadence for humans, seems to fall between 170-180 strides per minute.

When your cadence is always the same, a lot of things seem to fall into place. When you cadence stays at a steady rate, it requires that you vary your stride length when you're running at different speeds. If you think of changing your stride length to accommodate different levels of effort, your body learns to run with a set of gears and work in much the same way as your bicycle or your car.

Several clients have said that running with a metronome gives them a sense of stability in their running because their cadence becomes the single constant that underlies everything else that's going on when they're running. This allows them a greater ability to focus on other ChiRunning Form Focuses. I love running with my metronome and I use it almost every time I run, and always in races. It helps me most in creating a sense of effortlessness in my legs and it is without question the best training tool that I've ever run with.
<h5><strong>How to use the metronome to improve your running</strong></h5>
<h6><strong>Step One: Determine Your Current Cadence</strong></h6>
When you first begin to work on your cadence you should start by measuring your current cadence (the number of strides you take per minute). To determine the cadence you're currently running, take your metronome and go out for an easy run at whatever pace you would run for a typical training run. For this test be sure to run on a flat course and preset your metronome to 170 bpm. Then, turn the volume off.

After about 5 minutes of running, turn the volume up on the metronome and match the beep of the metronome to your stride rate by pressing the (+) or (-) button. It may take a minute or two for you to perfectly align both, but just feel the rate at which you sense your feet hitting the ground, and then adjust the
beep of the metronome faster or slower until it's a perfect match with your stride rate. Then, note the beats/minute reading on your metronome and you'll know your current cadence.
<h6><strong>Step Two: Run at this Cadence for One Week</strong></h6>
Practice running with your metronome at your measured cadence for one week. Let's say for example that it's 170 strides/minute. Set your metronome to beep at that rate and start it  then you begin each run. Practice matching your cadence to the beat of the metronome with every step you take, if you can. This will train you to maintain a steady cadence no matter what your speed. That's right! Your cadence should stay the same whether you're running fast or slow, up or downhill, or trying to catch a bus. Keep it the same, no matter what and you'll learn to be a <em>highly</em> efficient runner because you'll never be caught overstriding or overworking your legs!
<h6><strong>Step Three: Increase your cadence to fall between 170-180 strides/minute</strong></h6>
Your cadence should ideally range between 170-180 strides per minute. If you're a tall or long-legged runner you could run with a cadence closer to 170 spm. If you're a short legged runner (like me) you should aim for a cadence closer to 180 spm.

Run for a week with your metronome set at whatever cadence you're starting at. Then, after a week, increase the setting on your metronome by one beat per minute and run every run for the following week at your new cadence. By upping your cadence only one beat per week, your body will barely notice the cadence increase. This gradual way of increasing your cadence is much easier on your body than trying to run at your ideal cadence right away. It gives your body time to adjust to a new way of running.
<h6><strong>Step Four: Run to a Waltz Beat</strong></h6>
Actually, this can happen during Step Three. To keep your body balanced, it is better to run with a waltz rhythm which goes like this:

<strong>Set your metronome to beep on every third foot strike. So your footsteps with the beat would go: right 2, 3…left 2, 3…right 2, 3…left 2, 3…beep 2, 3…beep 2, 3…just like a waltz.</strong>

I suggest using the waltz rhythm as soon as you have gotten through your first week of using a metronome. You can use it right after you've determined your beginning cadence. A nice added feature of this is that you don't have to listen to as many beats every minute.

Here's a conversion chart for switching to a waltz rhythm. It's a simple calculation. Take your current cadence and divide by 3.

<h6><strong>Step Five: Use Your New Cadence to Improve Your Form</strong></h6>
There is no better training tool than a metronome for learning to vary your stride length to accommodate different speeds. Once you're comfortable running with your metronome, do
this workout with the metronome set at your ideal cadence and keep it going the entire time. Warm up for 5 minutes and then run one minute intervals, without missing a beat, changing
gears every minute. You can shift gears up or down during these 1-minute intervals, but I suggest only running in your first 3 gears. One thing you can't do is vary your cadence. It's a
good challenge to allow your stride length to go longer or shorter depending on the gear you're running in.
<h6><strong>Here are the four gears:</strong></h6>
1. Warm-up pace (very easy pace)
2. Training pace (the pace you would run your longest run - aerobic)
3. Race pace (the pace you would run in a race - High-end aerobic)
4. Sprint speed (your top speed - anaerobic)
<h5><strong>The Racers Edge</strong></h5>
When I'm running competitively I trick my body into going a little faster by
raising my normal tempo of 180 up to 182. On race day I run at this slightly
faster tempo and my body hardly notices the difference. This gives me a little bit
of an edge that can make a difference in a race. Two more strides per minute
will add on about twelve additional feet per minute, which means that I can
literally drop minutes off my half marathon time without feeling any increase in
my effort level.

Aside from the metronome, it is always important to practice the basic
ChiRunning form focuses. Your core needs to be engaged and your posture
aligned. Your shoulders should be relaxed and your arms swinging easily as you
feel for the sweet spot of your lean. Do two of these form workouts each week
and you’ll have fabulous running technique in no time.

	Your body thrives on rhythm&hellip; your heart beat, your breath rate, your love for dancing, are all based on rhythms in your body or that you&#39;ve established in your life. The more rhythms you establish, the better your body likes it.</p>
<p>
	When you&#39;re body has a rhythm to follow it doesn&#39;t work as hard. It knows what to do and when to do it. If you go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, your body experiences a rhythm... ""now I get to rest, now it&#39;s time to get up.""</p>
<p>
	One rhythm I&#39;m acutely aware of when I run, is my cadence&hellip;the number of strides I take per minute. I have found that most people do best when they run with a steady rhythmical cadence. It varies slightly from person to person based on height, body structure and personality type, but the optimal cadence for humans, seems to fall between 170-180 strides per minute.</p>",2017-10-10 16:38:00,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/the-quickest-way-to-improve-your-running-with-a-metronome/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/metronome_new-e1528985141714.jpg,metronome_new-e1528985141714.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/metronome_new-e1528985141714.jpg,1075,metronome_new,,,,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/metronome_new-e1528985141714.jpg,,,,,,,,,Technique,ChiRunning,publish,5,dannychi,danny@chiliving.com,Danny,Dreyer,the-quickest-way-to-improve-your-running-with-a-metronome,,default,0,0,0,closed,closed,2018-11-06 15:09:40

6471,March 2019 Instructor of the Month: Jean Gillis,"<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<em><img class="" wp-image-6474 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/JeanGillis-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""195"" height=""260"" /></em>I live in rural Central Massachusetts with my husband on our mini farm. When I’m not busy caring for our menagerie of animals, dogs, chickens, horses, sheep, and more, I coach athletes in groups, and 1-1, for marathons and triathlons, and I teach group fitness.

<strong>How did you start running?</strong>
I had always been active in sports, playing soccer since a young age. Then when I was in college, a friend of mine inspired me to start running road races. Once I started, I never stopped.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
I came across ChiRunning at an event expo, bought the book, and started practicing on my own for a few years. Then I decided that I wanted to get more serious about it, and really figure out if I was doing it correctly. So I participated in an all day workshop with Vince Vaccaro, one of the longest teaching instructors, in July of 2016. At this workshop it totally clicked for me and I was absolutely hooked.

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong>
Prior to practicing ChiRunning, I didn’t associate running with relaxation, and I used digging in and “muscling” to go faster. Now I’m able to go further, faster, with less effort. One of my ambitions for learning ChiRunning is to be able to run a 100 mile ultra and not suffer like I’ve seen some runners suffer. I think with ChiRunning it’s possible!

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?</strong>
I think the biggest misconception is that ChiRunning is slow running, or something alternative that’s not for serious runners.

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>
Being outside, being self powered, exploring by foot. Keeping my mind and body feeling good. Competing in races and blowing through my mental limits.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
Coaching a 60 something year old client to run her first 5k, even though she joined the class expecting to only ChiWalk. As well as realizing my passion for endurance sports, and launching my own business. I worked in the corporate world for 15 years and got laid off. At that point I had been volunteer coaching a triathlon team for four years, and I decided to make the leap to making coaching my full time career. My business is Jean Gillis Wellness, endurance coaching.

<strong>What led you to become an Instructor?</strong>
Taking the all day workshop with Vince helped me to confirm what the technique should feel like in my body, and it felt awesome. At this time I was already coaching athletes, and I wanted to be able to share this with them, and runners everywhere!

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an Instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I know that running changes, and can even save lives. It has been shown to help people overcome things like depression, anxiety, addictions, low self esteem, and more. I feel honored to be able to introduce people to running in a way that will help them to enjoy it more and avoid injury, as well as to help injured runners come back to a sport that they love. ChiRunning started out as a way to improve my own running technique, but has now become a large part of my business, and a way that I get to connect with and support lots of cool people!

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
It depends on the time of year, but I typically run three times a week, two shorter runs, and a longer run. I enjoy mixing it up, from different technique focuses, to different surfaces, flat, hilly, trails.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
In addition to ChiRunning, I swim, indoor and outdoor, and bike. I also do strength training, and yoga.

<strong>Advice for people new to Chi Running?</strong>
Instead of seeing it as something to get done or accomplish, come at it with an attitude of exploration. ChiRunning does take practice, but it’s so worth it; particularly if you want to run long in to your years! You can learn a lot about your body just by paying attention. Rather than running through pain or discomfort, you can learn how to make the right adjustments to move more in harmony.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race you’ve run and why:</strong> <em>Stone Cat 50 mile trail run because my husband and I ran it together. Running that distance is very challenging, and it was so special that we were able to support each other through it.</em>

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> <em>Lake Placid Ironman. I appreciated every moment because I almost bailed on the race. We were moving to a new house the weekend before the race, and I felt very overwhelmed. I’m so glad I went!</em>

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> <em>50 degrees, sunny with scattered clouds.</em>

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> <em>I’m currently playing with cadence.</em>
<em>It’s helping to shorten my stride. I like alternating matching the arm swing or the ankle lift to the beat, and noticing the change in my heart rate.</em>

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> <em>In the woods</em>

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> <em>Warm quinoa with a drizzle of honey, nuts, and blueberries.</em>

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> <em>Recently, I’ve been really enjoying smoothies with banana, almond milk, cocoa powder, and peanut butter.</em>

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> I run without music because I prefer to tune in to my body, breath, and surroundings.

<strong>If I didn’t run</strong> I would spend more time swimming and biking because I know that physical activity and being outside make me a happy camper!

<strong>I can’t run without</strong> first doing a little warmup of high knees, butt kicks, side shuffles.

<strong>My first marathon was</strong> <em>Boston and I had an amazing time running in memory of my mom and raising money for Ovarian Cancer.</em>

<strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is </strong><em>Altras</em>

<strong>My most difficult run ever was</strong> <em>the half marathon at the end of a half ironman triathlon and I had some tummy issues. </em>

<strong>I’ve ran</strong> <em>9 marathons/races.</em>

<strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> <strong>is </strong><em>50 miles in Massachusetts.</em>",,2019-03-19 17:07:58,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/march-2019-instructor-of-the-month-jean-gillis/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/JeanGillis.jpg,JeanGillis.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/JeanGillis.jpg,6474,JeanGillis,,,,,,,,,,,,,Beginners|Inside Chi,ChiRunning,publish,6,kellychi,kelly@chiliving.com,Kelly,,march-2019-instructor-of-the-month-jean-gillis,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-04-26 16:53:02
6950,May 2019 Instructor of the Month: Harrison Wong,"<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-6951 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Harrison-300x200.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />I am a Canadian Chinese living in Hong Kong, a triathlete and marathoner. I used to operate a garment manufacturing/exporting business for 20 years, when I met ChiRunning in 2013, beside the transformation of my running experience and lifestyles, this brought me the opportunity to let me grew passionately my interest into a career. I am the regional director of the Asia Pacific region to spread ChiRunning/ChiWalking in my region.

<strong>How did you start running?</strong>
I started running in early 30s since I was alerted by my poor health condition caused by my lifestyle working as a frequently-travel businessman.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
In 2013, ChiRunning was introduced to me by a swimmer in my training group of Total Immersion®, I was then marveled by this revolutionary running technique! I found myself benefiting from ChiRunning immediately in my running and triathlon races: no more fatigue, no more pain, and a much better result under the same effort level.

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?</strong>
ChiRunning brought me performance and efficiency in my sports, running is no longer pain and exhausted, especially in my Ironman race - the run after the bike leg. By the way, practice through focus on breathing, through Y’Chi, I started to grasp the key of running meditation, and amazingly, a few months after I started ChiRunning, I built up my body-senses and have my spine alignment and posture alerted most of the time no matter I was sitting, standing, walking or running, I could do meditation with crossed-legged for hours which I couldn't do it before. I also found that when my body has reached the moment of “cooperate with nature forces, return to innocence” and mastered the mind-body connection, running is not just a sport, but a lifestyle. There is a more profound philosophy in that.

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>Many people think ChiRunning is for slow runner and jogger since we emphasis the Relaxation. But not until they truly understand our revolutionary training way: Form, Distance, Speed in gradual progress - the correct form is built to create a good condition for speed to happen.

<strong>What motivates you to run?</strong>
The joy, and the health benefits.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
Becoming a Master Instructor.

<strong>What led you to become an instructor?
</strong>I believe in “The best things in life must be shared with others!”

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an Instructor, and how has it affected your life?
</strong>“Whoever teaches learns in the act of teaching, and whoever learns teaches in the act of learning.”, I found that the more I share this techniques with others, my understanding of Chi-principles gets deeper; It is my honor to shoulder the responsibility of spreading ChiRunning in the Greater China Region. (Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese internal martial art)

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?
</strong>Running 5-6 days per week, road running for an hour or two on weekdays, longer trail running on weekends, speed workout on track bi-weekly if a target race is being set.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
Swimming and Cycling

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?
</strong>If you want to run fast, first master how to run slow.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race you’ve run and why:</strong> My first Ironman Race after I approached ChiRunning, because I can really “Run” even after the bike leg.

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> Same

7119,Lactic Acid & The Key to Fresh Legs,"<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Lactic Acid &amp; The Key to Fresh Legs</strong></h2>
The word “lactic acid” seems to strike fear in the hearts of most runners. It’s gotten so much hype in running articles we’re led to believe it’s like drinking poison. So, let’s put some of those fears to rest. As a ChiRunner I rarely have to deal with the downside of lactic acid build-up, and I want every runner to experience what that’s like.

<em>Lactic acid is not the boogeyman of running.</em>
<h4><strong>What Lactic Acid Feels Like in Your Body</strong></h4>
<img class=""wp-image-7128 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sore-legs-lactic-acid.jpg"" alt="""" width=""247"" height=""247"" />

Having an over-abundance of lactic acid in your body can present itself as cramps, weakness in the muscles and sometimes nausea. These symptoms of fatigue usually go away within a few hours if you stop exercising.

If you experience sore muscles, it’s more likely NOT lactic acid build-up, but from working your muscles beyond their current capability, which is not always a bad thing.
<h4><strong>What creates Lactic Acid build-up?</strong></h4>
Lactic acid is caused by running at an anaerobic pace where your body requires more oxygen than your lungs can provide. <strong>It is a <em>by-product </em>of anaerobic exercise, and not a <em>waste</em> product, which is what most people are led to believe.</strong> That’s because once the anaerobic period ends, the lactic acid can be broken down into useful components for the body. Here’s how it breaks down:
<ul>
 	<li>70% of lactic acid produced is oxidized and <em>used</em> by the body during aerobic exercise</li>
 	<li>20% is converted to glucose (energy) in the liver</li>
 	<li>10% is converted to protein</li>
</ul>
Your body produces lactic acid in a few different ways:

<img class=""alignright wp-image-7134 size-medium"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sprinters-on-track-300x276.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""276"" />
<ol>
 	<li>Short, intense bursts of speed without enough oxygen available to sustain your effort</li>
 	<li>Beginning runners starting up a running program whose muscles aren't used to the workload of running</li>
 	<li>Increasing speed or distance too quickly (We suggest upgrading your training no more than 10% each week!)</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Is lactic acid a bad thing?</strong></h4>
It’s really only bad for you when there’s a build-up in your system that doesn’t get broken down by your body to be used as glucose fuel or protein. This happens when there’s not enough oxygen in your body to break it down into its usable components.
<h4><strong>How can I avoid building up too much lactic acid?</strong></h4>
The trick to not producing an over-abundance of lactic acid is to run in a way where you either don’t produce it to begin with (run aerobically) or you run in a way that allows your body to “recycle” it into useful components.

Your body burns glucose and glycogen for fuel. Glucose resides in your blood. Excess glucose is stored in your liver and muscles as glycogen, which is the basic fuel your body runs on. It is created by your consumption of carbohydrates. The process of burning glycogen is called glycolysis. There are basically two ways your body burns glycogen… either with, or without, oxygen.

When you’re sprinting or running in an anaerobic state, your body requires more oxygen than your lungs can provide. This state is only possible for a very short periods, usually seconds, with sprinters. This triggers the production of lactic acid which is a by-product of glycolysis.

The focus here is not so much how to deal with lactic acid as how to prevent its over-production in the first place. If you’re a sprinter you need to deal with it. But, if you’re a distance runner there are ways you can inhibit the production of lactic acid by remembering a few good pointers. So, what’s the hurry?

Lactic acid is produced when there is little or not enough oxygen… anaerobic exercise. This means that it will be produced <em>any time</em> your muscles are not getting enough oxygen to burn cleanly and without producing an over-abundance of lactic acid.

How many times have we all sat around a campfire that is smoking like crazy. When there is not enough oxygen delivered to the wood it doesn’t burn hot enough and usually creates tons of smoke. Then, everybody in the way of the smoke has to move or sit farther back… which defeats the whole purpose of having a nice cozy fire to begin with. Abundant smoke inevitably happens when someone puts a huge log on the fire, and there’s not enough heat to draw air into the flames. So, the fix for this is to either rearrange the fire to where there is enough oxygen to keep the log burning… or use smaller firewood!

This is very similar to someone running in a way where there’s not enough oxygen getting to their muscles. A proper burn can’t happen and efficiency drops. Interestingly enough this anaerobic state doesn’t only happen to sprinters, but happens in distance runners who <em>run</em> <em>inefficiently</em> or <em>breathe</em> <em>inefficiently</em>. For many runners it can be both.
<h5><strong>Work on your running efficiency</strong></h5>
<img class="" wp-image-5174 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/img_0800_15618382076_o-200x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""259"" height=""389"" />When you run inefficiently you’re using more energy to move your body than is necessary. Poor biomechanics, muscle tension and even mental tension keeps your body from moving as smoothly as it would if these problems didn’t exist. But they do. And, our job as mindful ChiRunners is to be watchful and body sense what we might be doing to <em>contribute</em> to our own fatigue, and then do what we can to eliminate these trouble spots. The most basic principles of ChiRunning teach runners and walkers how to move in a way that dissipates tension, improves ease of motion, and reduces impact. In ChiRunning, you don’t work as hard to run, so you can actually <em>reduce</em> your body’s workload at any speed, and not require as much oxygen.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-7139"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/runner-taking-a-break-to-breathe-hands-above-head-185x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""252"" height=""409"" />

A simple way (and you’ve heard it forever) is to warm up slowly and be sure to cool down at a slow pace as well. This allows your body, at the start of your runs, to gradually adjust to the sudden increase in the demand for oxygen. At the end of your runs, it allows your body the time to break down any residual lactic acid in your system. If you don’t do a cool-down jog or walk, it could extend this time to hours, or days if you’ve done a hard workout.
<h5><strong>Work on improving your oxygen uptake while running</strong></h5>
The main cause of lactic acid build-up is running in an anaerobic state, where your lungs aren’t producing enough O<sub>2</sub> for glycolysis to happen in your muscles. Changing how you breathe can have a huge effect on this problem.

A recent trend in training for runners is to improve one’s oxygen uptake through nose breathing. In his book, <em>The Oxygen Advantage, </em>Patrick McKeown talks about the importance of nose breathing and how it works to build a more extensive and efficient delivery system of oxygen to the muscles. In short it’s a great way to get your body to become more tolerant to CO<sub>2, </sub>which is the molecule responsible for transporting O<sub>2 </sub>to your muscles. When you chest-breathe and mouth-breathe (as sprinters do) you breathe in excess oxygen and breathe out too much carbon dioxide. This can starve your lungs of oxygen and increase the workload to your heart and lungs as well as your chest and neck muscles.

For distance runners, nose breathing trains you to breathe more slowly and deeply so you can take more advantage of the CO<sub>2  </sub>transfer system and get more oxygen to your muscles with each breath. In the end you learn to breathe less to accomplish more.

As you combine highly efficient running technique with higher quality breathing practices, you won’t have to go through all the lactic acid build-up and elimination cycles that most other runners have to deal with. You won’t “hit the wall” or get muscle cramps because the lactic acid in your system will never me beyond your body’s ability to eliminate it as you run.",,2019-05-22 13:23:53,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/lactic-acid-the-key-to-fresh-legs/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v41.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/img_0800_15618382076_o.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sore-legs-lactic-acid.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/sprinters-on-track.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/runner-taking-a-break-to-breathe-hands-above-head.jpg,standard-featured-image-v41.jpg|img_0800_15618382076_o.jpg|sore-legs-lactic-acid.jpg|sprinters-on-track.jpg|runner-taking-a-break-to-breathe-hands-above-head.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v41.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/img_0800_15618382076_o.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/sore-legs-lactic-acid.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/sprinters-on-track.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/runner-taking-a-break-to-breathe-hands-above-head.jpg,4804|5174|7128|7134|7139,standard featured image v41|img_0800_15618382076_o|sore legs lactic acid|sprinters on track|runner taking a break to breathe- hands above head,||34943053 - hamstring sprain or cramps. running sports injury with female runner. closeup of woman back thigh.||,||||,||||,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v41.jpg,,,,,,,,,Technique|Performance|Training,ChiRunning,publish,7,haleychi,haley@chiliving.com,Haley,,lactic-acid-the-key-to-fresh-legs,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-05-22 16:03:57

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ChiRunning's foundation in t’ai chi, an ancient physical, mental and energetic practice, makes running not just a sport and a way to keep healthy, but a mind-body practice to gain self-knowledge.  In ChiRunning you learn to Body Sense, carefully listening to your body and always moving with the primary precepts of injury prevention and energy efficiency as the foundation of each run. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yoga, too, is an ancient practice to discover and explore the physicality and energies of body, mind and spirit. Different asanas, or yoga poses, are an opportunity to experience the inner structure of your body and being, and to discover where you feel strength, fluidity and balance, as well as weakness, tension and imbalance. It’s a great way to get to know your capacities and your limits, physically and energetically and gentle expanding those boundaries.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In t’ai chi, ChiRunning and in yoga, the practice is to become aware without responding impulsively.  First deepen your awareness by paying close attention, move into acceptance of where you are in the moment and then perhaps make gentle, informed  adjustments to get more stability and more flow. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Abrupt changes can be harmful to the body and hurtful to the psyche. Trying to go deeper into an asana before your body is ready can cause damage, just as pushing too hard to run faster can cause injury. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To prep your body for a run we recommend warming up with our Body Looseners which are specifically designed for ChiRunning.  After a run, we suggest you do the following yoga poses, preferably right after, but anytime after is beneficial. Yoga is also the perfect cross-training for the days you don’t run. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yoga helps activate muscles and joints, increases your flexibility, and helps you relax, which is at the heart of ChiRunning: a strong core with everything else loose and responsive.  In ChiRunning, as in yoga, relaxation is what allows you to move fluidly, with ease and grace. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yoga strengthens and tones your body while it also gently stretches tight muscles. Conscious belly breathing is also a practice that both disciplines share. And, of course, both yoga and ChiRunning ask you to be present with your body and all the feelings that arise while practicing. Frustration, pride, joy or emptiness are all human experiences that offer a window into our deeper nature. </span>

7243,7 Pilates Exercises to Improve Your Running,"<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">7 Pilates Exercises to Improve Your Running</h1>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><em>Written by: <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/instructor/amelia-vrabel/"">Amelia Vrabel, Senior Instructor</a>
Colorado Springs/Denver, CO</em></strong></h5>
<a href=""#section1"">View 7 Pilates Exercise to Improve Your Running</a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the biggest things I love about ChiRunning is that it’s thrown the whole concept of “no pain, no gain” out the window. (Seriously - that’s so, like 1985!) By working with the forces of nature and engaging your mind </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> body to move forward, running becomes a mindful and enjoyable whole body movement that promotes health and wellness.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A key area of focus as a ChiRunner or ChiWalker is to maintain proper alignment and posture throughout the movement. The core muscles are engaged to stabilize the body each time the foot lands on the ground and when the body is in the flight phase of the stride as well. . </span>
<h5>Consciously Engaging Core Muscles in Pilates &amp; ChiRunning</h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a Certified ChiRunning/ChiWalking Instructor, I have found that for many it’s not that they lack the core strength to hold themselves in proper alignment, but rather that they have forgotten how and when to engage the strong, stabilizing muscles of their core. Once upon a time as children, we naturally engaged our core muscles, but years of sitting behind desks, in front of televisions, and driving in cars has nullified our innate use of these muscles– that includes when we run as well. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In both Pilates and ChiRunning, we are mindfully and consciously learning to bring these crucial, stabilizing muscles back into your movement habits. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Personally, I use classical Pilates to  complement my ChiRunning practice because they share many fundamental principles: </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whole body and mindful movement</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper body alignment</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pelvic stability</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Core engagement</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Focused, intentional movement. </span></li>
</ul>
<h5>Moving Mindfully with Pilates</h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve been practicing classical Pilates regularly now for several years. I’m fortunate to have fantastic teachers and a lovely studio (Whole Living Pilates in Colorado Springs, check it out!) that affords the opportunity to work on different types of apparatus (mat, reformer, chair, spine corrector, tower, etc.). With each movement the focus is never how far you can go or how hard you can work, it’s about doing the movement correctly and learning the feeling within your body (Body Sensing!). </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this way, Pilates is a lot like ChiRunning. It doesn’t matter how far or fast you can run, the point is doing so efficiently, with good posture, and paying attention to how your body feels.  In Pilates and ChiRunning, the point is to create healthy, positive movement habits. You don’t push harder until you can maintain that proper movement for the duration. It is way better to move smoothly and correctly and from there, you can progress in your strength building or your running distance without fear of pain or injury. </span>
<h5>Whole Body Movement</h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In both practices, you maintain a sense of where your pelvis is in space, how to stay tall with good posture, and how to feel your core engaged.  You’ll feel your body moving as one whole unit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Pilates, the fun movement challenge is to feel this cohesive body movement from various positions.  Ultimately all this varied practice helps you find your core while you’re running or no matter what you’re doing.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through Pilates I practice Body Sensing that I then bring into my ChiRunning practice. I’m either lying on the mat and really reaching through the crown of my head, feeling my core engage, and keeping my pelvis level as we perform a Pilates exercise. Or,  I’m on the roads or trails also reaching through the crown of my head and feeling my core engage as I fall forward and catch myself with my next foot strike. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s never one body part acting alone - it’s mind and body fully integrated and connected throughout the practice.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s “no pain, ALL gain!""</span>

7290,July 2019 Instructor of the Month: Sarah Richardson,"<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class="" wp-image-7340 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""390"" height=""519"" />I currently live in Vermont with my awesome husband Mike, who is also a runner and athlete of all kinds. We have a super fluffy cat named Pumpkin and I have the pleasure of being a step-mom to two inspiring women, one here in Vermont and the other over on the West Coast in LA. We have a sprawling piece of property on Lake Champlain where we host a few Summer ChiRunning Camps and wind down our days enjoying the sunsets. I grew up on the south shore of Long Island and although it was within an hour of New York City, it was very rural and nature was easily accessible. Our home was across the street from a 2,500 acre wildlife refuge and a 6 minute boat ride to the ocean. I had easy access to miles of trails, beaches and wide open spaces. My love for the outdoors began there. Horses, beaches and running were my passions during my school years and kept my mind and body sound. I attended the Audubon Expedition Institute, an experiential program for Graduate School, and traveled the country exploring social, educational, and environmental issues. It was an incredible way to see and learn about the US, camping out every night under the stars and hiking a LOT of backcountry. I fell in love with teaching during that time and then attended The College of St. Rose where I received a Masters in Education with a focus on Special Education. That’s when my official teaching career began (2000-ish). Currently, I’m a Special Educator at a local high school, U-32, where I head the Transition Academy. It’s a program for students between the ages of 17-22 with intensive needs and profound disabilities, both physical and intellectual. It is a very rewarding position and has made me an even more compassionate and patient human being. And it compliments my role as a ChiRunning instructor because it is effortless for me to differentiate instruction. I can meet people wherever they are, and break content down to very understandable concepts and deliver it in multi-sensory ways. So if you think you can’t learn how to ChiRun or fall in love running again.. Let me have a try! I can guarantee I’ll figure out a way for it to happen!!!!

<strong>How did you start running?
</strong>Running has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. When we were little, if my brother and I fought, my mom would have us run 5 laps around the house. By the second lap we would be laughing and best friends again. When I was 5 I ran my first race! My friend’s dad was a track coach and he brought us to the Colgate Women’s Games in NYC. I came in dead last! But it was my first experience with the intensity and excitement of the sport and it was awesome! I remember cheering for people all day after I ran. I was hooked!!!!!

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
After running for 30 years with very few injuries, I literally stumbled into an acute injury. During an adventure race, I fell in a pothole and twisted my ankle pretty bad. I chose to finish that leg and a third leg afterwards. I rested for a while after that to recover, but for the next 3 years I was plagued by a host of injuries, which were new to my body, and it sucked the fun out of running. Hip issues, hamstring issues, and metatarsal discomfort... In order to figure it out, I went to a ChiRunning clinic with Danny in Boston and before the end of the day, I was “cured.” I knew why my body was responding the way it was and experienced immediate relief and was able to get back to running! By the end of the day I was so happy and asked how I could teach it to other people because it was just BRILLIANT!!!

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?
</strong>I was never a fast or competitive runner. I always loved the peacefulness and calm it brought to my mind. It was really nice to meet other people who thought of running in the same terms and wanted to take care of their bodies through running rather than use their running as a punishment or a short term goal. Upon meeting Danny and other ChiRunning Instructors/ChiRunners I knew I had met my tribe. They are my people! What changed was I felt validated for my beliefs about running.

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>That you don’t need it or it doesn’t apply to you. There is a misconception from struggling or beginning runners that they aren’t good enough yet to need a running coach or advice on their running. And there is a misconception from highly competitive runners that they already know it all and would not benefit from ChiRunning because it doesn’t promote pushing harder. I hear both of these judgments regularly and I believe they are short sighted because I’ve worked with people who would fit into both groups, and every client I’ve worked with who has gotten through all of the content has said that it’s the best thing they’ve done for their running.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7339"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""659"" height=""439"" />

<strong>What motivates you to run?
</strong>Being outside, feeling good in my body. I love to feel strong, accomplished and clear in my head. I crave the calming effect running has on my mind and body. When I was injured I didn’t know how much running regulated my body, because I had never not run before. But there I was, not able to run and became plagued by anxiety to the point of being medicated. As soon as it I was able to run consistently again I was able to ditch the medication and self-regulate through running.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
I have 7 full marathons, 7 halves and countless 5k/10k’s under my belt and I’m super proud that I’m still running, safely and soundly for the past 5 years! It was awful to be injured and I’m glad I got the help from ChiRunning when I needed it. I actually wish I had done it sooner. Asking for help is a strength and something to be proud of!!!
<p dir=""ltr"">The publication of my book From Sidelines to Start Lines: The Frustrated Runner’s Guide to Lacing Up for a Lifetime. It’s a self-help book for struggling runners and gives practical strategies to go along with the ChiRunning technique that help you get back into running. My coaching programs are based on it and integrate mindset, lifestyle and form for a well rounded holistic approach to running.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Having a story published in Chicken Soup for the Soul: Running for Good. It just came out in June, 2019 so it’s fresh on my mind!!!</p>
<strong>What led you to become an instructor?</strong>
The minute I attended my first clinic I was hooked. I KNEW I wasn’t the only runner who was frustrated and going crazy not being able to run because of an injury. I’ve been able to take back my life through the sport of running and want to help others do the same. And it all makes so much sense from a technical standpoint! ChiRunning is a concept/technique that I can wholeheartedly stand behind. Who wouldn’t want to become more efficient and experience fewer injuries???? The teacher in me knew I had to learn it and share it.

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I’m a teacher through and through. Runners are super cool and ask great questions. I love helping people and especially love seeing the “lightbulb” go on when they get it. It’s my mission to facilitate as many, “A-ha,” moments as I can! Plus, I always learn so much from each runner I work with, which makes me a better person and a better teacher of the content. Being a ChiRunning instructor has also taken me to different parts of the world. I have assisted Danny at Kripalu in Massachusetts and in NYC, I’ve taught clinics in Dallas, TX, hosted retreats in Vermont, and I’m introducing the ChiRunning concepts at a Women’s Retreat in Fiji in 2020! Super exciting!!!

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
I’m an early riser and enjoy getting my runs in just after dawn (or before dawn during the winter). I like to do “something” every day. My typical week has me running on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I walk on Tuesdays and Fridays and I reserve Sundays for whatever I feel like! It could be a mountain bike ride, a fun run or just a leisurely hike out in the woods. My typical run is between 40-60 minutes.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
I like all things outdoors… Mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, walking, and skate skiing in the winter. I have to say that I do all of these with more efficiency, confidence and strength since becoming a ChiRunner. Many of the form focuses have a positive impact on other activities &amp; sports! Body sensing is a life changer and has kept me sound across the spectrum.

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong>
Listen to your body! Learn to love the messages it gives you. Allow yourself to develop a relationship with yourself. When you’re first learning, take it one form focus at a time and continue to work on it until your body begins to automates it. Be open to and feel the shift, then thank your body for adapting. Our bodies are designed to heal. When we set up the conditions for it to do so, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can change! Notice these changes and celebrate!
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race and why:</strong> The Boilermaker, Utica, NY. Saranac rewards the neighborhood that provides the most support to runners with block party, so the crowd of spectators for the whole 15k is incredible. It is awesome to be in the midst of 13,000 runners feeling like each community member is cheering for you. And the ice pops (and beer) at the end are awesome!

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> The Honolulu Marathon. It was my first full and I just LOVED it! The training, the race and the vacation changed my life! And I still have the tattoo to prove it!!!

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> A light rain that starts just <i>after </i>I'm<i> </i>warmed up!

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Landing on and maintaining my tripod because I still have a tendency to roll to the outside of my left foot since the pothole incident. And Cadence, always cadence!!!!!

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> The trails on Isle La Motte in Vermont. And I especially love to run while on vacation. Running has allowed me to see so much of the world and in such an intimate way.

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> A Buttered Hard Roll with poppy seeds on top from Stewarts (Upstate New Yorkers will know)

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> It doesn’t matter… Anything!!!!

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> Island Vines 10k this September, RaceVermont Fall Half in November. In 2020 my goal is to run the New England Series (6 Half Marathons in 6 Days) and a trail Ultra.

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> No music. No earbuds.

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> I don’t use a playlist. Just the beeping of a metronome!!!",,2019-07-09 19:07:52,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/july-2019-instructor-of-the-month-sarah-richardson/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_1.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_2.jpg,SarahRichardson_1.jpg|SarahRichardson_2.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_1.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/SarahRichardson_2.jpg,7339|7340,SarahRichardson_1|SarahRichardson_2,|,|,|,,,,,,,,,,Beginners,,publish,6,kellychi,kelly@chiliving.com,Kelly,,july-2019-instructor-of-the-month-sarah-richardson,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-07-09 19:35:09
7357,"The Chi Insider on Barefoot Running, Minimalist Running & Natural Running","<h2><b>Barefoot Running, Minimalist Running, Natural Running – ChiRunning Supports it All</b></h2>
<h5><b>Why has barefoot running become an important topic in the running community?</b></h5>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-7362"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/runner-on-road-barefoot-with-shoes-beside-him.jpg"" alt=""Close up legs of man with black running shoes on asphalt road in morning time"" width=""452"" height=""282"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot running is obviously not a new idea... I’m sure cavemen and women did it. But, growing popularity of barefoot and minimalist running has rocked the running world in recent years, partially because of the success of the Kenyans and other African runners who have shown that growing up running barefoot has helped them establish world-class results in every distance from the 10K to the marathon. Barefoot running has led to the burgeoning minimalist shoe industry and has caused many of the “old guard” shoe companies to rethink shoe design from the ground up. And, as barefoot/minimal running gains more traction, there are also reports of injuries from barefoot running that need to be kept in mind. </span>
<h5><b>Barefoot running and natural running</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running with no shoes, or in a minimalist shoe, allows your feet to move and flex in a more natural way than when they’re strapped into a sometimes confined space that can be stiff, constricted, too heavy or too thick, which is how too many running shoes are designed. When your feet can move freely as you run, it allows your entire body to settle into a more natural and easier way to move. In many ChiRunning classes, I’ve asked the students to take off their shoes and briefly run up and down the track. What I immediately see is a very different group of runners than I was witnessing only moments before. Their knees are more bent. They’re not over-striding and heel striking. They’re lighter on their feet. Their stride shortens and their cadence is quicker. This is the way humans were designed to run. And, what I have known for about 25 years, is that some of the time it’s the shoes that are making it more difficult for people to feel the ease they </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">could</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have with their running.</span>
<h5><b>What are the benefits of barefoot running? </b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ChiRunning is about teaching you how to run barefoot-like, as if you had run barefoot or in minimal shoes your whole life. The barefoot running concept came about, in part, when we began to observe that lifelong barefoot runners are generally  more efficient and have excellent running technique. The Tarahumara runners of Mexico, who run multi-day races in huarache sandals, were mentioned in Chris McDougall’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Born to Run</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. These runners, like the Kenyans spend most of their lives running barefoot, or in minimalist shoes, and both cultures have the stride mechanics that runners envy. <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7365"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/couple-smiling-running-on-beach-happy-barefoot.jpg"" alt=""exercising running couple jogging on beach. runners training on sand by the ocean smiling happy in full body length. interracial fit fitness couple, asian woman and caucasian man runner."" width=""615"" height=""411"" /></span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running barefoot, or in minimal shoes, means you have no cushioning on the soles of your feet. This forces you to use a shorter stride and a higher cadence to accommodate for the lack of protection on your feet. A shorter stride length keeps you from overstriding or heel striking. The lack of cushioning encourages plantar flexion and a forefoot/midfoot strike which also reduces impact.</span>
<h5><b>Is running barefoot, or in minimal shoes, better for you?</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on how you run, it might be better and it might not. The way I’ve always approached the running shoe dilemma is to try to convince runners that if you can learn to run barefoot-like, you’ll be better off than most runners regardless of the shoes you wear. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The problem with barefoot running today is that adults, who have never run barefoot, have been led to believe that if they too run barefoot, they will gain the benefits other barefoot runners enjoy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work that way. Many barefoot runners are getting injured because their running technique does not improve and change as quickly as they had hoped, or were led to believe. Years of sitting at desks and wearing inappropriate shoes can leave us with ingrained body habits that take time to change. Patience in this situation is not only a good idea, it’s the law. Your body needs time to change and adapt to a new way of moving and it’s not a process you can rush.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot running does not automatically change all those years of habits. And, unfortunately for some, not necessarily quickly enough to stave off injury. The concept of barefoot running has shown us that there is a basic, running technique natural to the human form. ChiRunning is about taking you back to that natural running technique through a series of exercises and technique focuses that you can mindfully practice. That’s why we call it “barefoot-like” running, and it’s been proven to reduce impact and improve your running economy.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s a very perceptive quote from Dan Liebermann, a professor in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, who has studied, and written extensively about barefoot running.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span>
<blockquote><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“How one runs probably is more important than what is on one’s feet, but what is on one’s feet may affect how one runs.”</span></blockquote>
<img class="" wp-image-7368 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/67023673_s.jpg"" alt=""Two athletes runners couple running together on beach. People from behind jogging away barefoot on sand on tropical travel destination. Lower body, legs, feet."" width=""552"" height=""368"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Both parts of Liebermann’s statement are true. I’m a big believer that if you can run (or walk) with an efficient, low-impact style, it doesn’t matter </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">as much</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> what’s on your feet. So, as  I sit down to write this article, I find myself not so much writing about barefoot running per se, as about the case for</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">practicing good running habits.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some of the important points about barefoot running I’ve gleaned from reading many studies* comparing running barefoot, or minimal shoes, to running in conventional shoes. I’ve also added in what I’ve learned from coaching countless runners of all abilities and body types.</span>

<h6><b>Benefits of running barefoot or in minimalist shoes</b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strengthens the intrinsic muscles in your ankles and lower legs (this is good if you have structural or muscular weakness in your lower legs, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">not</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as good if you have normal or over-developed lower legs)</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Improves the range of motion (ROM) of your ankles and Achilles tendons</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Can possibly help you transition from a heel strike to a midfoot/forefoot strike (but not guaranteed)</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps increase knee flexion during the landing and support phases of your stride (lower impact)</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps shorten your stride and increase your cadence (which reduces over-striding, a main cause of increased load rates and impact) </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allows you to sneak up on someone quickly!</span></li>
</ul>
<h6><b>Things to be aware of running barefoot or in minimalist shoes</b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As much as possible, relax your lower legs so that if you plantar flex upon landing, you don’t stiffen your ankles and actually create more impact. This will help prevent metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis which can happen with runners not used to running barefoot or in minimalist shoes.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running barefoot, or in minimal shoes feels awesome, but can lead to injury if you don’t take the time to transition slowly and allow your feet and legs to adapt.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When downhill running you should maintain a shorter stride length and a higher cadence to reduce impact.</span></li>
</ul>
<h6><b>The advantages of learning ChiRunning (barefoot-like running)<img class=""alignright wp-image-7370"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Sandpit1ANIMATION.gif"" alt=""danny dreyer demonstrating sandpit exercise in front of group of chirunners"" width=""320"" height=""427"" /></b></h6>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can run safely in most running shoes especially shoes that are light-weight, flexible, lightly cushioned, comfortable, foot-shaped and with less than 7mm drop.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your running economy becomes less dependent on the shoes you wear (heavier running shoes are the exception).</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ll have a healthy running technique that will serve you well for the rest of your life.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You become more mindful in your running practice which leads to constant improvement. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can choose to run barefoot or in minimalist (or zero-drop) shoes without fear of injury.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you run, you strengthen only the muscles that need to be strengthened which allows you to accomplish more… while relaxing more.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your shoes last longer so you don’t spend as much of your hard-earned money on shoes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simply said, if you run with less impact and less muscle stress, you’ll have fewer injuries. Which is what we mainly focus on in </span><a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ChiRunning workshops</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and in all our </span><a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/products/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">training materials</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span>
<h5><b>The case for wearing more minimal shoes</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My description of the best shoe for you is: </span>
<blockquote><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">least</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> amount of shoe you can </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">safely </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">run in, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">given the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">way </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you currently run </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and the longest distance you currently run.” </span></blockquote>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This means that if you have a good, efficient, low-impact running style, you can get away with  wearing less of a shoe for a longer distance. On the other hand, if your running style is heavy, high-impact, and/or high-effort, you might need a more supportive or cushioned shoe, and have to run less mileage until your technique improves. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over-built running shoes have too much drop from heel to toe. Some shoe companies are now designing shoes with less of a drop, or no drop at all called zero-drop shoes. Zero-drop shoes can range from minimal sole thickness (4mm), up to over 30mm thick. In this case, more is not better. Remember they still have to allow your feet to flex. Having too thick of a sole on a shoe can leave you less sensitive to how you’re connecting to the ground. </span>

<img class="" wp-image-7373 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Danny-and-Lisa-demonstrating-at-denver-workshop-1.png"" alt="""" width=""385"" height=""516"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a minimalist shoe, a lightly cushioned zero-drop shoe, or barefoot, it’s easy to tell when you’re landing wrong or pushing off too much. That’s because with less shoe you can actually feel what your feet and legs are doing. ChiRunning and ChiWalking classes focus a lot on Body Sensing, which increases your ability to sense what’s going on in your feet as well as the movement patterns in your body. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As your technique improves, your taste in running shoes will naturally change to less of a shoe, which means more flexibility and overall freedom for your feet.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running well can mean the end of most repetitive motion injuries caused by poor mechanics. Whether or not you decide to try barefoot/minimalist running, we always suggest you proceed with caution and allow your body to transition over an extended period of time.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is why I always urge runners to improve their running technique instead of trusting their shoes to make the difference. We never like to see people gambling with their running, whether they’re beginners or elites. </span>

7416,Running After Sixty: The How & Why,"<h1>Running After Sixty: The How &amp; Why</h1>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve been running since 1971. That was the year when this 21-year-old Colorado boy got drafted and sent away to boot camp in California. As I entered the Army I started running to maintain some semblance of sanity in a military world that was completely foreign to me.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, 48 years and running, and a hundred thousand miles later, I still rely on my running to smooth the edges of my busy business, <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/"">travel, teaching and speaking schedule</a>. It has never disappointed. Running is still key to my physical and mental health, and provides me with the energy to garden, kayak, cook and enjoy life to the fullest. <img class=""wp-image-7337 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ron-huntsberger-testy-1.jpg"" alt=""danny with two other runners from ChiRunning Training Group after the Asheville Marathon"" width=""364"" height=""364"" /></span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through the decades I’ve witnessed my body change from being totally out of shape when I started running in my 20’s, to cruising along in my 30’s, to racing ultramarathons in my 40’s, to running full and half marathons in my 50’s and 60’s, and still with a lot of ease and enjoyment. I  love to train for events and I still podium regularly in my age group, which has gotten pretty easy considering how few runners compete after turning 60. Many ChiRunners are running well into their 80’s. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since my 40’s, the one thing that has been consistent is my use of technique to make running easier and healthier for my whole body.</span>
<h5><strong>The Benefits of Running as You Age</strong></h5>
<strong>The risks of running are mitigated with good technique. The benefits out-weigh the risks by a long shot. Here’s the short list of great reasons to run after 60:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improves memory and brain function¹
</strong>Don't lose your quick wit as you age! The more you exercise, the more ""fit"" your brain becomes, especially your memory centers. Even a single run can change the way your brain functions almost instantly. <strong>
<img class=""wp-image-7421 alignnone"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/brain.jpg"" alt="""" width=""503"" height=""283"" />
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Helps to prevent age-related muscle loss²
</strong></strong>Less physical activity is common among older people, which is the biggest contributing factor to deteriorating skeletal muscle. This leads to countless other health issues and, ultimately, the loss of independence as you age. <span class=""bard-text-block style-scope"">Follow the old adage: </span><span class=""bard-text-block style-scope"">""Use it or lose it!""</span><strong><strong>
</strong></strong><img class="" wp-image-7424"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-man-running-with-young-female.jpg"" alt="""" width=""503"" height=""336"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Boosts your immune system³
</strong>Not only does physical activity reduce chronic diseases as you age, but it also helps prevent viral and bacterial infections by boosting your immune system. As you age, so does your immune system, but frequent exercise can delay the aging process of your immune function too! <strong>
<img class="" wp-image-7433 alignnone"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/109847314_s.jpg"" alt=""Senior man and woman and young female instructor workout on fresh air. Outdoor activities, healthy lifestyle, strong bodies, fit figures. Stylish, modern sportswear. Different generations"" width=""503"" height=""336"" />
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Promotes good heart health<sup>4
</sup></strong>Aerobic exercise, like running, is the best thing you can do to strengthen your heart! The benefits don't stop there: A healthy heart means better blood flow to all parts of your body. <strong><sup>
<img class="" wp-image-7430 alignnone"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/47633391_s.jpg"" alt=""sport woman touch on hand watch health application"" width=""503"" height=""336"" /></sup></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Helps to build stronger bones<sup>5
</sup></strong></strong>In recent studies, high-impact endurance activities, like running, have outperformed resistance training when it comes to prevention of bone density loss. While it may see counterintuitive, the skeletal sites that receive stress from exercise, become stronger.<strong><strong>
</strong></strong><img class="" wp-image-7426"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-pointing-to-her-smile–-strong-bones.jpg"" alt="""" width=""503"" height=""336"" /></li>
 	<li><strong><strong>Improves balance<sup>6
</sup></strong></strong>ChiRunning is derived from T'ai Chi, a practice that's proven to improve balance. The combination of the two is like being balanced in motion. Adults 60 and over begin to struggle with their balance, but the more you challenge it, the more you strengthen it! <strong><strong><sup>
</sup></strong></strong><img class=""wp-image-7428 "" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-practicing-tai-chi-in-park-balancing-on-one-foot.jpg"" alt=""calm barefoot athletic senior woman performing yoga balancing exercises on one leg at outdoor park with green grass and copy space"" width=""503"" height=""336"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Promotes healthy, happy knees<sup>7
</sup></strong>Many people think that running ruins your knees. New studies show that running can actually benefit these joints! Even better news: With ChiRunning, you actually take all the ""heavy lifting"" off your knees and take high-impact out of the equation.<strong><sup>
<img class=""wp-image-7432 alignnone"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/active-older-couple-kneels-to-drink-water-and-talk-.jpg"" alt="""" width=""503"" height=""335"" />
</sup></strong></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Taking care of your brain, as well as your body, becomes even more important after 60 and can help </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">slow the onset of Alzheimer’s and dementia</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.<sup>8</sup> Brain health, along with your physical health, should be right on top of your to-do list as you age. The focuses of ChiRunning help develop new neural pathways between your brain and your body. In recent years neuroplasticity has been tied to aging. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt and organize around input from life. It is also the brain’s job to delete unused neural pathways that no longer serve. Promoting healthy new neural pathways is what ChiRunning provides through mindful movement.</span>
<h5>How to Optimize Running in Your Sixties:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Always work on running with good technique</strong>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Practicing good, efficient, low-impact running is the best replacement for dwindling muscle mass. Aging<img class=""wp-image-7460 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/danny-with-two-aging-runners-after-a-private-chirunning-workshop.jpg"" alt="""" width=""455"" height=""340"" /> requires us to run with more finesse and less brute force. That finesse will come from focusing on being highly efficient in your running and walking regardless. Paying consistent attention to your technique will pay off in spades as you age. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The ChiRunning technique strengthens your core, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">engages your mind</span>¹<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, improves your </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">heart health</span><sup>4</sup><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bone density</span><sup>5</sup><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> balance</span><sup>6</sup><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and helps you get out the door on a regular basis to nourish body and soul.
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span></li>
 	<li><strong>Adjust your ChiRunning form
</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Always maintain proper postural alignment:</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Years of sitting at a desk, driving a car or poor postural habits can leave older folks (and even some younger ones) with too much curvature in their thoracic spine. You can address this by standing tall and counteracting the constant downward pull of gravity. Lifting at the crown of your head straightens your spine which supports your body (<a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"">ChiRunning School Lesson #1</a>) and helps you move in a more unified way. Having great posture can also make you feel lighter on your feet.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Shorten your stride:</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the easiest thing to do whenever your legs or lungs are feeling stressed. It quickly lowers impact and makes it easier to manage your energy output when you're on flat ground or going up hills.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Relax and lengthen your stride on downhills:</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you age, it’s crucial to maintain a good range of motion (ROM) in your joints, especially your hips and lower back. This is best done with one of my favorite ChiRunning skills: Passive Pelvic Rotation (<a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"">ChiRunning School Lesson #17</a>), for two reasons: 1.) To create a shock-absorbing effect, directing the impact away from my knees, hips and lower back. 2.) To maintain good ROM as I allow my hip flexors, quads, and lower legs to extend behind me with each stride.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>Learn active pelvic rotation:</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This is an advanced ChiRunning focus where your obliques drive your hips, which in turn drive your legs (<a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"">ChiRunning School Lesson #22</a>). The better you get at this valuable technique, the less you use your legs for propulsion, and the stronger your core feels. Balance and stability are the two most important benefits of engaging these deep core muscles. I use Active Pelvic Rotation running uphill… or if I want to sustain a faster pace on the flats.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>It's okay to slow down</strong>
Actually, it’s not only okay, it’s the law. As we age, both men and women produce less testosterone, a key building block of muscle mass. This creates a natural slowing of the muscle synapses which in turn restricts your speed. I can’t avoid getting slower as I age but I have been able to slow down the <i>rate </i>at which I’m losing speed by doing strength training (resistance work) or short speed intervals. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And, the slowing down process doesn’t have to begin as early as some people think. I hear 45-year-olds talking about their body slowing down. And there is truth in that. At 45 you’re no longer 25. But, we hear many, many stories of people getting faster from ChiRunning... at every age.
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span></li>
 	<li><strong><strong><strong>Make running as easy as possible with run-walk intervals<img class=""alignright wp-image-3460"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/older-woman-walking-on-dock-in-front-of-mountains-ChiRunningGet-StartedChiWalk-Runner.jpg"" alt="""" width=""485"" height=""367"" /><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
Run-walk as needed</span><b>. </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good technique and using our Chi Walk-Run technique means you can rest as needed. There’s no law that says you can’t stop and walk in the middle of a run. Walk when you feel you need to recover your breath, drink water or take a break. I really enjoy pausing in the midst of beautiful surroundings or expansive views. I put no pressure on myself to keep running at all costs, and I allow myself opportunities to give my body a reset by taking walking breaks.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/product_category/chiwalk-run/"">ChiWalk-Run program</a> is perfect for beginning runners (yes, even if you’re 60+ years old) and perfect for anyone who wants to continue to run but with more rest breaks. In the ChiWalk-Run program, you learn the keys to transitioning between walking and running by maintaining good technique in both.</span></strong></strong></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Listen to your body without judgment </strong>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a true act of surrender and acceptance to just “be with what is” in your running. Nothing is good or bad. It’s just information that needs to be responded to and learned from… nothing else. Always ask yourself, “What’s the best ChiRunning focus I can use right now, given my current challenge?” Keep a kind, appreciative attitude towards your body. It works wonders when you’re feeling challenged.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I see way too many people dropping out of running in their later years and there’s no need to if you practice good technique and allow your body to slow down a bit. You can’t stop the aging process, but you can slow it down by taking a positive and smart approach to being with what is. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span>

<strong>Running after sixty can be less challenging than you’d think, and a fabulous, life-extending learning opportunity.</strong>

7493,Why I Walk Every Day,"<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why I Walk Every Day</b></h2>
<em><strong>Written by: <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/"">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The number one reason I walk every day is simple: because many years of experience have taught me how much better I feel when I walk.  A day without walking is truly like a day without sunshine. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since walking is low impact (with high benefits) it is safe to walk every day and by doing so, you establish a healthy habit that becomes part of your routine. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In T’ai Chi and in Chinese Medicine energy that gets stuck is what causes pain, fatigue and even illness. The more I feel this in my own body, the more I want to walk which helps keep energy flowing. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When the clear benefits became obvious to me, walking became an absolute priority. Nothing compares with a 40-minute walk to set the stage for a great day, except maybe running. But I’m generally a walker. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Who doesn’t want to:<img class=""alignright wp-image-3258"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/group-of-women-chiwalking-with-katherine-dreyer-ChiLivingChi-FitnessChi-Walk-Run.jpg"" alt="""" width=""423"" height=""320"" /></span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">have more energy</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feel clear and balanced emotionally</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">have a more focused mind</span></li>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">keep aches and pains at bay? </span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I walk every day because good energy is everything to me. Creating positive, flowing energy is the best way for me to really enjoy life. On my walks, I almost always stop and do about 10 minutes of Qigong. Wow, is that the perfect combo.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meanwhile, getting into nature, breathing fresh air, feeling the change of seasons and enjoying every kind of weather is deeply and profoundly enlivening to the spirit. Did you know that the worst air pollution is indoors? Everyone needs more time outside. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because I walk every day, I know that many people are fair-weather-walkers. If it’s the perfect day, there are many more people out running and walking, but come the cold or rain, I have the trail practically to myself. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have the right gear for heat, cold, rain, and snow. A windy storm with thunder and lightning is my only true deterrent. Walking is my sunshine, even when it’s raining. Besides, I love the rain. Walking in the rain makes me feel like a kid again. </span>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><b>ChiWalking Helps Heal Injuries</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class="" wp-image-4301 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/man-and-woman-chiwalking.jpg"" alt="""" width=""460"" height=""348"" />Before I walked every day, I walked 3-4 times a week, but still had some low back trouble over the years. By walking every day not only have I staved off back pain, but I’ve also healed some foot and Achilles tendonitis problems too. Not only do I feel better, but I have a deep sense of confidence in myself and my body. Since I’ve been walking every day, I am healthier than I’ve ever been in my life. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It took me a long time, but I can now walk with the most minimal shoes. The first year I tried, I went too minimal too fast and got the Achilles tendonitis problem. I’ve also had plantar fasciitis. In both cases, I knew I needed to work on my technique even more, so I did. I learned to relax my lower legs even more and eliminate any push off. I still practice all the ChiWalking form focuses for the same reason I walk; because they feel so good. </span>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Multi-tasking while Walking</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While walking I meditate, practice various breathing techniques, improve my balance on curbs on the road. Walking dates are one way I keep up with my friends as well. <img class=""wp-image-7496 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/walking-group.jpg"" alt=""group of chiwalkers with danny dreyer walk happily on a concrete pathway "" width=""509"" height=""279"" /></span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At 59 there are many things I have had to reduced significantly: chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, GMO wheat products, red meat, even popcorn no longer agrees with me. I still indulge now and then, but having reduced these so-called pleasures, as me and my girlfriends have discussed…at least we know we can still walk and breathe, walk and breathe. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I do miss maybe one or two days a month and when I do, I’m acutely aware that something vital is missing.  Mostly I have an energetic experience of being sluggish, tending a bit more toward irritability, and generally feel less present with myself. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The benefits of walking are well documented and the list almost endless. But reading about those benefits and actually experiencing and living with them is as different as reading about an orange versus biting into its live, sweet juiciness. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you start with 3-4 days a week you’ll soon experience some significant differences and maybe want more; more energy, more fresh air, more satisfaction, more movement. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The benefits are incalculable in terms of longevity and quality of life. From lowering the risk of cancer and heart disease to greatly reducing depression and the risk of diabetes, it is truly the miracle cure everyone is looking for. </span>

<strong>Add a little Chi to the mix and life becomes different, better, even more joyful. What’s not to like? </strong>",,2019-07-31 15:48:21,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/why-i-walk-every-day/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/chi-workshops-featured-image.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/walking-group.jpg,chi-workshops-featured-image.jpg|walking-group.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/chi-workshops-featured-image.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/walking-group.jpg,3268|7496,chi workshops- featured image|walking group,|,|,|group of chiwalkers with danny dreyer walk happily on a concrete pathway,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/chi-workshops-featured-image.jpg,,,,,,,,,Lifestyle|Health &amp; Wellness|Mindfulness,ChiWalking|ChiLiving,publish,7,haleychi,haley@chiliving.com,Haley,,why-i-walk-every-day,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-08-01 15:43:59
7528,Running Injuries: Accident or Human Error?,"<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Running Injuries: Accident or Human Error?</h1>
<em><strong>Written by: <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/katherine-dreyer/"">Katherine Dreyer</a>, Co-founder of ChiRunning, ChiWalking &amp; ChiLiving</strong></em>

<img class=""size-full wp-image-7536 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Word-Art.png"" alt="""" width=""1041"" height=""480"" />

In 2014 there was a push in the media, and a new requirement in many state laws, that car accidents should no longer be called accidents, but to more accurately be called a crash or collision. The idea was to get people to realize that human error is the main cause of accidents.

According to the New York Times, “Almost all crashes stem from driver behavior, like drinking, distracted driving and other risky activities. About six percent are caused by vehicle malfunctions, weather, and other factors.”

We don’t have exact statistics for running injuries, but we do know that running is a high injury sport and many of those injuries could be avoided with good running technique and appropriate training.

Generally, we put running injuries into two main categories: <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/injuries/"">Impact and overuse injuries</a>. <strong>For now, let’s look at three areas to explore the nature of running injuries:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Running injury from an accident
</strong><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7542"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/116706005_s.jpg"" alt=""Young woman with hit knee lying on the ground while active man leaning over her for help"" width=""519"" height=""346"" /></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Running injury from a lack of knowledge or experience</strong>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Running injury from human error</strong>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Running injury from an accident </b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Life happens– unavoidable accidents are just a part of being human. Just like being in a car accident that is not your fault, there are times you get injured and there’s not a darn thing you can do about it, such as being hit by a bike, vehicle or another runner who has tripped and taken you down too. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slipping on an unexpected patch of ice or mud could also fall into the accident category. Tripping, rolling your ankle on a curb, getting your shoelaces caught in a tree root on a trail can mostly be in the accident category. But in actuality, there are techniques and a level of conditioning that could mitigate the chances of even that happening. So yes, they are accidents, but in many cases could also fall into the human error category. </span>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-7548"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/31166355_s.jpg"" alt=""runner falling and getting injured on trail while female runner runs behind him"" width=""564"" height=""376"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I used to think rolling my ankle and tripping were accidents, but I’ve learned that the ChiRunning technique is a strong deterrent to both. Strengthening your core, as you do in ChiRunning, and creating proper balance makes you less likely to roll your ankle because you are more agile and light on your feet. The Chi Focus of lifting your ankle makes you less likely to trip over roots, rocks or uneven terrain. All the technique focuses help you to become more aware of your body, the requirements of the terrain, and the needs of the moment.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, accidents happen, but just like car crashes, there is a lot you can do to be a safe driver and a safe runner. </span>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><b>Quick tip for trail running:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Fold the loops of your laces into the web of your laces and you’ll never get yanked by your shoelaces getting caught in a branch again. </span></p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Running injury from a lack of knowledge or experience</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teaching my daughter to drive was not an easy experience. Terrifying, actually. Today, (knock on wood) she’s truly a good, and safe driver, at least when I’m with her. I know she’s aware of the dangers and consequences of unsafe driving habits.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I taught her to never tailgate; always be aware of kids, animals, and other cars on the road; maintain a safe speed; and to put on a playlist of music </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">before</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> taking off, so she can focus on the road. I started pointing out unsafe drivers about a year before she got her driver’s permit in addition to difficult or dangerous places that needed special attention in our small but busy city. Of course, she also participated in Driver's Education, which is required in North Carolina like most other US states. </span>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3049"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/danny-dreyer-teaching-posture-the-chiwalking-technique.png"" alt="""" width=""471"" height=""340"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to running, most people don’t get the kind of education and support they need. This led us to create the <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/chirunning-school/"">ChiRunning School</a> to educate runners on how to run safely and correctly! Similar to Driver's Ed, we think proper running education should also be required for new and experienced runners alike! We’ve got the idea that “just doing it” or “give it your best shot” is the best way to run. For a limited few it works, but usually, as those ""natural athletes"" age, they need <em>more</em> than their natural inclination to keep them going and injury-free. Learning some basic skills builds confidence and dramatically reduces our potential for injury, especially for beginners.</span>

<strong>Injuries from lack of education are, I think, the biggest of these 3 categories. Here are some conventional misconceptions about running: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can’t learn to run– just run as you did as a kid</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s supposed to be a strenuous workout for it to be valuable</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your legs need to get stronger for you to get faster</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speed matters</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you walk-run it should be in specific intervals</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You should be able to run a 5K in 8 weeks, a 10K in 12 weeks, a half marathon in 16 weeks and a marathon in 20 weeks. Some plans are more aggressive than that, even for absolute beginners. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have pain, knee or otherwise, you’re not meant to run</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or, the worst one of all: running is painful so just run through the pain (“No Pain, All Gain”)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each one of these beliefs can lead to a host of unnecessary injuries, from either impact or overusing muscles that should hardly be used in the first place. These beliefs can also keep you from enjoying this wonderful sport, thinking your running days are over at the first sign of pain.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The truth is, with some simple adjustments, you could continue running for the rest of your life. Your body is built to run– no matter your age or body type. </span>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Running injuries from human error and making mistakes</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This last category is what happens when people know better, but don’t listen to their body, their intuition, or the basis of knowledge they’ve cultivated. These injuries are the crashes and collisions of human error and run the gamut of running injuries: from knee pain to shin splints to plantar fasciitis and IT band syndrome. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hearing people say they’ve signed up for a half or full marathon but haven’t been training, I get the sense of an impending crash.</span>

<strong>Here are several mistakes I see people make causing injury (even when they know better): </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running too far or too fast for your level of technique and conditioning</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not listening to the early signs of pain</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trying to keep up with faster-paced runners </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Starting a run too fast without warming up</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stretching cold muscles</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overusing your lower legs, instead of using a gravity-assisted running technique</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor diet choices including dehydration, low electrolytes, not enough clean fuel</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor-fitting, worn-out or overbuilt shoes</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not adapting your technique to the terrain</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As one of our </span><a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/find-a-workshop/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Master Instructors</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> recently said, “It’s crucial to get your mind’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">concept </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of what you should be able to do, out of your running, and let your body’s needs rule your workouts.” </span>

<b>The bottom line:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Running is a high injury sport but you’re far less likely to injure yourself when you get the education and support you deserve while maintaining a mindful approach to your practice.  </span>

7571,September 2019 Instructor of the Month: Aaron Lew,"<h2>Tell us a little about you. Where you live, what your background is. What (if) you do in addition to being a Certified Instructor.</h2>
<img class="" wp-image-7573 alignleft"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Aaron-Lew-243x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""275"" height=""339"" />I am Lew Seng Leong (Aaron). I live in Singapore. I am a Certifying Master ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking Instructor, a Garmin Coach and a Life
Coach/Motivational Speaker. My athletic background is in multi-sports racing and coaching, now I am mainly coaching ChiRunning &amp; ChiWalking. I have raced every distance from 5k to ultras, triathlons, IRONMAN to adventure racings.I am a full-time practicing Engineering Professional in addition to coaching CR.

<strong>How did you start running?
</strong>I started running to build up my aerobic fitness for competitive volley ball games when I was a teenager.

<strong>When and how did ChiRunning come into your life?</strong>
I knew ChiRunning in the early 2000 when I raced competitively in triathlons and adventure racings through a Total Immersion (TI) swimming coach. Back then, running efficiently with good technique was never that important so to speak, for most of the competitive athletes around me.
I am fascinated by ChiRunning that stresses running with the pull of gravity with strong core muscles rather than depending on the leg muscles to run. I managed to get hold of ChiRunning DVDs, audios and books, then the rest is history…

<strong>In what ways has Chi changed your perception of and success in running?
</strong>The idea of running simply by moving the Dantien forward in great posture is amazing! Knowing the deep potentials and practical use of our core muscles such as the active/passive pelvic rotation to run faster has been an eye-opening experience for me too.

In addition, chi also maximize the use of our bone structure (the strongest components in our body) when carry out a weight bearing exercises like running. The midfoot striking pattern and the vertical and directional alignment of chi is so fundamentally right with human body in the sport of long distance running. With an understandings of the ChiRunning principles, I find a true pleasure in every steps that I run!

<strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception of ChiRunning?
</strong>ChiRunning may be is only for the older generation/seniors or the injured runners.

<strong>What motivates you to run?
</strong>I run because it gives me a sense of FREEDOM and helps me to stay fit.

<strong>What achievements are you most proud of?</strong>
I am proud to change the life of a senior (in his 60s) who never run, from walking with hip pain to running on track in 8 weeks.

I am also proud to coach a runner in his 20s, from failing IPPT (for a few times) to clinching a GOLD AWARD in his IPPT (Individual Physical Proficiency Test) as part of his National Service obligation in Singapore.

<strong>What led you to become an Instructor?</strong>
I like to share the joy of ChiRunning and help all liked minded people to sustain and achieve their goals with good running and walking technique.

<strong>Why do you enjoy being an instructor, and how has it affected your life?</strong>
I enjoy being connected to people as an instructor. I learn to speak, organize and having the confidence to coach people with different backgrounds. Coaching has broadened up my horizon.

<strong>What does your average week look like, run-wise?</strong>
I run typically 25-30km a week. Most runs are after office hours, running home with my camelbak. I am doing once a week 20-30 minutes barefoot run on a green field with gentle hills on it.

<strong>What other forms of exercise do you practice to compliment ChiRunning?</strong>
I am doing functional training and core exercises regularly.

<strong>Advice for people new to ChiRunning?</strong>
ChiRunning is a life long learning process. New ChiRunner needs to learn to relax and give themselves time to build up good habit.
<h2>Short answer! Okay, GO.</h2>
<strong>Favorite race and why:</strong> Standard Chartered Marathon. It is a well organized race that is held every year around December. This is the last race of a season, I get to run together with a few close buds, pacing each other, afterwards I can relax a little before the next season begins!

<strong>Most memorable race:</strong> Mountain running and adventure racings in China with top class athletes all around the world in the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest in 1999 and 2001.

<strong>Ideal weather for running:</strong> Cool 18-20 degree celcius, running in the mountain.

<strong>Focus that currently dominates your running:</strong> Lift the Crown of Head, Move The Dantien

<strong>Favorite place to run:</strong> Barefoot runs on a big green field with some small hills.

<strong>Go-to before race food:</strong> Coffee and bread

<strong>Celebratory food after:</strong> Fish porridge with milk tea

<strong>Upcoming race/goal:</strong> I like to help more people to find the joy of running with ChiRunning

<strong>Run with or without phone/music:</strong> Occasionally running with music

<strong>Repeat on your playlist:</strong> iTunes Songs of the Summer (mixture of pop, dance and R&amp;B hits)

<strong>If I didn’t run</strong> I hang around with my kids.

<strong>I can’t run without thinking about</strong> Lifting the Crown of Head and Lead The Move With Dantien.

<strong>My first race was </strong>a 10km cross country run in the neighborhood of where I grew up and I started to realize I can do long distance running!

<strong>My current favorite shoe to run in is </strong>New Balance Zero Drop with Vibram sole.

<strong>My most difficult run ever was </strong>42km Ironman run.

<strong>I’ve</strong> lost count or <strong>how many marathons/races I've run.</strong>

<strong>The longest distance I’ve ran</strong> is a 50km ultra trail running challenge at the North Face Trail Running Challenge 2012, Singapore",,2019-09-03 18:42:32,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/september-2019-instructor-of-the-month-aaron-lew/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/Aaron-Lew.jpg,Aaron-Lew.jpg,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/Aaron-Lew.jpg,7573,Aaron Lew,,,,,,,,,,,,,Beginners,,publish,6,kellychi,kelly@chiliving.com,Kelly,,september-2019-instructor-of-the-month-aaron-lew,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-11-06 17:06:44
7584,The Solution to Stretching Before Running,"<h1><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Should You Stretch Before Running? </span></h1>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Time to address the age-old question: Should you stretch before you run? Does it help performance? Does it help prevent injury? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While no one enjoys running with stiff muscles, static stretching before running isn’t the answer. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Static stretching before you run actually makes it more likely that you’ll injure yourself by causing damaged tissue or strained/pulled muscles. In addition to this, studies have shown static stretching also has a negative effect on performance. </span>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Solution to Stretching Before You Run</span></h1>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try ChiRunning Body Looseners, which loosen your joints instead of stretching your muscles. These are actually derived from T’ai Chi warm-up exercises, but work wonders on the fluidity of your stride. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Body Looseners will warm up your muscles while making your joints open and loose, causing your chi to flow through your body unhindered. With loose joints, you won’t need to work nearly as hard! </span>

<strong>Body Looseners are intended to loosen the main joint systems of the body: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ankles</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Knees</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hips</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sacrum</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spine</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shoulders &amp; neck</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s a sneak peek at some of our favorite Body Looseners: </span></h3>
<h4><b>1. Ankle Circles</b></h4>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7615"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ankle-rolls-circles-body-looseners.gif"" alt="""" width=""608"" height=""648"" />
<h5 style=""padding-left: 30px;""><b>How?</b></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Stand in your best posture</li>
 	<li><b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Supporting your body on one leg, bend one knee to put your toes on the ground just behind you. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Move your bent knee in a clockwise circle while relaxing the ankle. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allow your knee to do the movement so your ankle can relax and loosen. </span></b></li>
 	<li><b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do ten clockwise circles and ten counter-clockwise circles. Repeat with your other leg.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h5 style=""padding-left: 30px;""><b>Why?</b></h5>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This exercise loosens all the ligaments and tendons around your ankles. </span></b></p>

<h4><strong>2. Knee Circles</strong></h4>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you begin every run, make sure to start off very slowly, focusing on your technique and warming up your muscles. Then gradually let relaxation and flow be the source of increased speed until you’re at your regular pace. By this time your joints and muscles are both loose and warm, and ready for your run. </span>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When Should You Stretch? </span></h1>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you don't stretch before you run, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stretch at all. The best time to stretch is right after your run when your muscles are warm. Stretching after running keeps your muscles from tightening or cramping.  It helps you recover faster and also preps your body for your next run or workout. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, do the stretches Danny recommends, go to an occasional yoga class, or <a href=""https://www.chirunning.com/blog/7-yoga-poses-for-chirunners/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">check out the yoga poses we recommend</a>. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stretching at the right time can have a big impact on your running– So remember, never before a run, regularly after a run, and do your Body Looseners before running. </span>",,2019-09-03 20:31:15,post,https://www.chirunning.com/blog/the-solution-to-stretching-before-running/,https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v09.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ankle-rolls.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/knee-circles.jpg|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-body-loosener.gif|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/spinal-twist.gif|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/ankle-rolls-circles-body-looseners.gif|https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/knee-circles-body-loosners.gif,standard-featured-image-v09.jpg|ankle-rolls.jpg|knee-circles.jpg|pelvic-rotation-body-loosener.gif|spinal-twist.gif|ankle-rolls-circles-body-looseners.gif|knee-circles-body-loosners.gif,/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v09.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/ankle-rolls.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/knee-circles.jpg|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-body-loosener.gif|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/spinal-twist.gif|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/ankle-rolls-circles-body-looseners.gif|/nas/content/live/chiliving/wp-content/uploads/knee-circles-body-loosners.gif,4380|7591|7595|7610|7612|7615|7617,"standard featured image v09|ankle rolls/circles, body looseners|knee circles|pelvic-rotation-body-loosener|spinal-twist|ankle-rolls-circles-body-looseners|knee-circles-body-loosners",||||||,||||||,"|ChiRunning Body Loosener, ankle rolls or circles demonstrated by a ChiRunning Instructor in a ChiRunning T shirt|||||",https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/standard-featured-image-v09.jpg,,,,,,,,,Beginners|Technique|Pain and Injuries|Performance,ChiWalking|ChiRunning,publish,7,haleychi,haley@chiliving.com,Haley,,the-solution-to-stretching-before-running,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,2019-09-03 20:37:57

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">A Talk with Esther Gokhale &amp; Danny Dreyer</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>See the video and offer from Gokhale Method below.</em></p>
<p class=""bard-text-block style-scope"">I met Esther Gokhale in 2018 when I was teaching at the Kripalu Yoga Center. When I learned what the Gokhale Method was all about, I realized there is a deep connection between what she is teaching her students and what we teach in ChiWalking and ChiRunning.</p>
<p class=""bard-text-block style-scope"">We decided to do a video together talking about one aspect of posture in daily life that affects us all: <b class=""bard-text-block style-scope"">sitting. </b>In our talk, we show how sitting is responsible for many of the ills that show up in our bodies as we age.</p>
We also both firmly believe that these can be prevented and reversed when we pay attention to our posture– when sitting as well as when we’re moving around in our daily lives. The importance of posture cannot be overstated because the quality of almost every action we do is dependent on a combination of the proper alignment and balanced movement of our body.
<h5>A Little About the Gokhale Method</h5>
<img class="" wp-image-7666 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/gokhale-method-esther-gokhale-adjusting-womans-posture.jpg"" alt="""" width=""267"" height=""347"" />The Gokhale Method is an ecosystem of posture and movement re-education which uses healthy posture and movement to help you restore your structural integrity and regain a pain-free life. Created by founder and CEO Esther Gokhale (GO-clay), the Gokhale Method draws upon the ancient body-wisdom passed down through non-industrialized cultures to repattern the way we sit, stand, walk, lift, bend, and sleep. Their goal is a world without back pain. Most students find relief following the first lesson — and without time-consuming exercises or special equipment. Esther’s book 8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back has sold over 150,000 copies worldwide and has been translated into 10 languages. Qualified Gokhale Method teachers offer instruction around the globe.

7669,Adding Speed with Ease: Active Pelvic Rotation,"<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Adding Speed with Ease: Active Pelvic Rotation</b></h1>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’d like to let you in on our secret: How to add power to your ChiRunning without increasing the workload to your legs. Sound crazy? Or, impossible? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our goal at ChiRunning is to convince you to run as relaxed as possible, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">especially </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">if you want to go faster. Our whole intent is to show you how to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fall forward, into the pull of gravity, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for your propulsion while at the same time </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">relaxing</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> your lower body, allowing the oncoming road to swing your legs for you. The sole purpose of doing these two things in your ChiRunning (falling and relaxing) is to redirect most of the workload away from your legs so that adding speed or distance to your running doesn’t cost you by increasing impact to your joints or overuse to your muscles.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the guiding principles of ChiRunning is mindfulness-based movement, where you’re constantly working to improve your ability to sense your body, engage your mind and progress in your skill level. With that in mind, Active Pelvic Rotation is a more advanced skill to gain easy speed as the next step in your ChiRunning. It happens when you exert and direct some of the Chi you’ve been cultivating. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Yesterday, I did a long trail run that is about 1000′ of climb and shaved off about 20 minutes!  Pelvic rotation on the uphills with improved arm swing made all the difference! I was flying in 3rd gear on the downhills with such ease that I was just laughing with joy!  And, no soreness or knee pain today.” <strong>– </strong></span></em><strong>Cheryl, Reno, NV</strong></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Falling forward is easier than pushing or pulling yourself forward. But allowing your legs to relax as you run can, for some, be a bit more challenging. That’s why we teach Passive Pelvic Rotation in all of our classes.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pelvic rotation has two modes: Passive Pelvic Rotation and Active Pelvic Rotation.</span>
<h4><b>Here’s what they are and how they differ:</b></h4>
<h5><b>Passive Pelvic Rotation</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In ChiRunning, you allow yourself to gently fall forward which allows gravity to pull you. Consequently, you are left with only having to pick up your feet to keep up with your forward motion. This significantly reduces the work done by your legs because, as you fall forward, you allow your lower body to relax, allowing your legs to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">be swung rearward </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">by the oncoming road. When your legs swing rearward as they hit the ground, impact to your knees, hips and lower back can become a thing of the past.</span>

<strong>The following illustration shows how conventional running (top) compares to ChiRunning (bottom). </strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class=""wp-image-7673 alignnone aligncenter"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""276"" height=""419"" /></span>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Conventional Running</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">      <img class=""wp-image-7676 alignnone"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""276"" height=""495"" /></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">
</span><b>ChiRunning Pelvic Rotation</b></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With conventional running your pelvis always faces forward and your legs swing from your hips. With ChiRunning, as you fall forward, your legs and pelvis swing together and your stride length increases in the rearward direction because, as your leg swings rearward, it pulls your hip with it, creating a rotation in your pelvis. This gives you a longer rearward stride without adding stress to the hip joint. And, as you might have guessed, a longer </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">rearward</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> stride (as the Kenyans have so beautifully demonstrated) equals faster speed.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">                </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is in stark contrast to conventional running which requires you to push yourself forward with every stride, which leads to chronic overstriding and is much less economical, especially if you’re running distances beyond a 5K. The muscle effort required to push you forward is what makes the typical runner more tired than they really need to be. It is much easier to pick up your feet than to push yourself forward when running.</span>

<img class=""wp-image-7683 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/pelvic-rotation-revised.jpg"" alt="""" width=""264"" height=""466"" />
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>“It was my best race so far.  I felt strong, and there were many times when everything just came together – pelvic rotation, legs swinging to the rear, relaxed feet and legs, circular feet... I would feel like I was flowing over the ground practically without effort! I had a strong finishing kick at the end, and my overall per-mile pace was over 30 seconds faster than the Flat Half on Sauvie Island that I did in July. I felt pumped and energetic afterward, and had no soreness, and still none today!”</em>  – <strong>Mary, Portland, OR</strong></span></p>
<b>Benefits of Passive Pelvic Rotation:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adds smoothness to your stride (think Kenyans) by preventing over-striding (braking)</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reduces impact, especially on downhills by emphasizing a rearward stride</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Creates a more unified system of body movement by coordinating your upper body with your lower body</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Protects your hamstrings from overuse by eliminating over-striding and “pulling”</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Easy to learn, and it’s a total game-changer when you change your mindset from power to relaxation</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Active Pelvic Rotation</b></h5>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class="" wp-image-7681 alignright"" src=""https://www.chirunning.com/wp-content/uploads/active-pelvic-rotationss.jpg"" alt="""" width=""226"" height=""233"" />This is an advanced version of Passive Pelvic Rotation that can be used for running faster or for running up hills. I call it “advanced” because, in order to do it, you must first have integrated Passive Pelvic Rotation into your repertoire of ChiRunning skills. In other words, once Passive Pelvic Rotation has become your norm, you can then add in some power from your core without upping the workload to your legs.</span><b> </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With Active Pelvic Rotation, you’ll gain “easy speed” by engaging your arms and your obliques, driven by your breath, which ups your amperage without blowing a fuse. An exaggerated arm swing, with an emphasis both forward and rearward, drives your hips rearward by engaging your obliques, which in turn drives your legs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With ChiRunning, natural degradation of how you move as you age can be averted to a safe, sustainable, and intentional way of going faster or farther without taking it out on your body. Engaging your stronger core muscles (in this case primarily obliques) to drive your hips and legs, keeps the smaller, more vulnerable muscles of your legs from overworking.</span>

<b>Benefits of Active Pelvic Rotation:</b>

<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Transfers your power source </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">away</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from your legs by engaging your obliques and arm swing</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Increases efficiency by using a larger, stronger group of muscles to replace a smaller muscle group… with the same, or better, results</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allows you to rely on two muscle groups (arms and obliques) few distance runners ever use</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adds power to your stride without relying on the strength of your legs</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you’re a new, or slower runner, or love to run fast, the source and impetus for your movement come from the same place when you practice ChiRunning– your pelvis. </span>
